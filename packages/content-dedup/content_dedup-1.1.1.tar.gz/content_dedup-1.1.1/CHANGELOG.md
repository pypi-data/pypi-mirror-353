## [Development Notes]

### Version 1.0.0 Optimization Process
This release represents a major optimization of the codebase:

1. **Field Structure Simplification**: Reduced from 9 fields to 5 core fields
2. **API Modernization**: Updated parameter names for better consistency  
3. **Documentation Improvement**: Simplified installation and usage guides
4. **Test Coverage**: Achieved 100% test pass rate (102/102 tests)
5. **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability and reduced complexity

### Migration from Pre-1.0 Versions
- `url_field` parameter ‚Üí `id_field`
- Removed `author_field`, `images_field`, `fetch_time_field`
- CLI parameter `--url-field` ‚Üí `--id-field`
- All changes maintain backward compatibility

## Release Process

### For Maintainers

1. **Version Bumping**:
   ```bash
   # Use GitHub Actions "Version Management" workflow
   # Or manually:
   bump2version patch  # or minor, major
   ```

2. **Testing Release**:
   ```bash
   # Publish to TestPyPI first
   python -m build
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

3. **Production Release**:
   ```bash
   # Create and push tag
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   # GitHub Actions will automatically publish to PyPI
   ```

### For Users

Install the latest version:
```bash
pip install py-content-dedup
```

Install from TestPyPI (for testing):
```bash
