# ImbBag

## Description

ImbBag is a specialized package that integrates a variety of bagging ensemble methods specifically designed for imbalanced data classification. This package provides a scikit-learn-based framework that simplifies the usage of these methods, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply them in their work, whether dealing with binary or multi-class classification problems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install imbbag
```


## Requirements

The following Python packages are required.

* scikit-learn
* imblearn >= 1.2
* PyGAD == 3.0
* ARFS>2.2
* mlxtend
* patch_sklearn
* scikit-learn-intelex

Also, use Python 3.11
