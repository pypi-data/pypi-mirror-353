| This module enhances the unbuild process of Manufacturing Orders by
  retaining
| information from the original move lines.

- | **Owner Retention:** The owner from the original move lines is
    always retained
  | automatically when unbuilding a Manufacturing Order.

- | **Location Retention (Optional):** A boolean field is available to
    retain the original
  | source and destination locations of the move lines during the
    unbuild process, if needed.

Usage
=====

| When unbuilding a completed Manufacturing Order, the owner from the
  original move
| lines is always retained automatically.

| If you want the components to be returned to the same locations they
  were originally
| consumed from, enable the checkbox labeled **"Restore Components to
  Original Location"**
| when creating the Unbuild Order. If this option is not enabled, Odoo
  will follow its standard behavior.
