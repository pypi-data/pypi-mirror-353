This module enhances the unbuild process of Manufacturing Orders by retaining  
information from the original move lines.

- **Owner Retention:** The owner from the original move lines is always retained  
  automatically when unbuilding a Manufacturing Order.

- **Location Retention (Optional):** A boolean field is available to retain the original  
  source and destination locations of the move lines during the unbuild process, if needed.
