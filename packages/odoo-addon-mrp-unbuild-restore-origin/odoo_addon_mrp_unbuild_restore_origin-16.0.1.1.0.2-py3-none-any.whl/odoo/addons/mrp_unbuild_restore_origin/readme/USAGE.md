When unbuilding a completed Manufacturing Order, the owner from the original move  
lines is always retained automatically.

If you want the components to be returned to the same locations they were originally  
consumed from, enable the checkbox labeled **"Restore Components to Original Location"**  
when creating the Unbuild Order. If this option is not enabled, Odoo will follow its standard
behavior.
