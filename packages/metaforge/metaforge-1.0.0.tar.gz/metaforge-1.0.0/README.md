# 🔧 MetaForge

**MetaForge** is a modular optimization framework for solving **Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP)** using advanced **metaheuristics** and **learning-based approaches**.

🚀 From classic solvers like Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms to modern DQN-based reinforcement learning and Neuroevolution — MetaForge brings it all together with clarity, structure, and fun.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Support for classic OR-Library and custom JSON benchmark formats
- 🧠 Modular solvers:
  - Tabu Search
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - Ant Colony Optimization
  - Q-Learning
  - DQN (naive & replay-based)
  - Neuroevolution
- 📊 Beautiful convergence plots, runtime comparisons, and Gantt chart visualizations
- 📦 Easy packaging, CLI usage, and extension with new solvers
- 🔬 Designed for researchers, students, and practitioners alike

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install MetaForge

```bash
pip install metaforge
```

Or clone locally for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mageed-ghaleb/metaforge.git
cd metaforge
pip install -e .
```

---

### 2. Run a Solver

```python
from metaforge.problems.benchmark_loader import load_job_shop_instance
from metaforge.metaforge_runner import run_solver

problem = load_job_shop_instance("data/benchmarks/ft06.txt")
result = run_solver("ga", problem, track_schedule=True)

print("Best Makespan:", result["makespan"])
```

---

### 3. Run All Solvers on All Benchmarks

```bash
python -m src.metaforge.utils.compare_solvers
```

Generates CSV, plots, and Gantt charts from `data/benchmarks/`.

### 4. Interactive Notebook

Explore MetaForge hands-on with our example notebook:

📓 [`MetaForge_Example.ipynb`](notebooks/MetaForge_Example.ipynb)

It walks you through:

- Loading benchmark problems
- Running various solvers (TS, GA, DQN, etc.)
- Plotting convergence + Gantt charts
- Comparing performance across solvers

Perfect for experimentation, demos, and academic use.

## 🧠 Why MetaForge?

Most libraries focus only on one type of solver. MetaForge unifies traditional, bio-inspired, and learning-based approaches in one clean, extensible Python package — built for experimentation, benchmarking, and educational use.

Whether you're doing a thesis, publishing research, or solving real-world factory problems — **MetaForge is your launchpad**. 🚀
