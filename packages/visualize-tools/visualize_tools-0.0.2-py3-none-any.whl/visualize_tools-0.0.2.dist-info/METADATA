# visualize_tools: A set of tools for visualization
Tools are adapted from visualization code written and used in researches with some (insufficient) rewrite and cleanup. Structure and API are subject to change. A minimal set of documentation is included, but digging into the source code may be required to use the API.  
## Commandline tools
Currently a single commandline tool is provided.
### img-set-diff
A tool to visualize the difference between two corresponding image sets, with an optional reference image set (the ground truth). Typically useful when analyzing and/or comparing performance of image compressing/reconstructing method(s).
