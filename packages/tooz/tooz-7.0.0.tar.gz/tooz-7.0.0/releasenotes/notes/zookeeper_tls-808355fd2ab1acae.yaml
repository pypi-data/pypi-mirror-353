    Added TLS support for Zookeeper.

    TLS-related options can be defined in a connection URL as query parameters
    and they will be passed to the Kazoo driver as client arguments.

    * ``ca``: SSL CA file to use for authentication
    * ``certfile``: SSL certfile to use for authentication
    * ``keyfile``: SSL keyfile to use for authentication
    * ``keyfile_password``: keyfile password
    * ``use_ssl``: controls whether SSL is used or not. Default to False.
    * ``verify_certs``: when use_ssl is True you can control whether to
      complete certificate validation

    This also bumps minimum kazoo version to >=2.6.0
