# ARES 3.0.0

## ARES: Advanced Toolkit for Financial and Non-financial Data Assessment

This release is an updated and restructured version of our previously published ML test model. It reflects continued development efforts aimed at enhancing the model’s applicability in real-world credit risk assessment tasks. The core structure remains based on the integration of both quantitative financial indicators and qualitative borrower attributes, such as audit status, legal proceedings, and external ratings. This hybrid approach ensures a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of default risk. The current release includes improvements in dataset consistency, additional control procedures, refined model functions, and updated documentation. These enhancements are part of a broader effort to transition from a prototype to a fully functional statistical tool designed for use by risk analysts, banking professionals, and researchers.

ARES is a comprehensive analytical toolkit designed to support statisticians, financial analysts, data scientists, and banking professionals in the processing and interpretation of structured financial and macroeconomic datasets. Developed by the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market (ARDFM), ARES facilitates a data-driven approach to credit risk evaluation.

## Key capabilities of ARES include:

- Structured loading and automated validation of financial datasets
- Computation and analysis of core financial ratios
- Development and performance assessment of regression models
- Implementation of statistical diagnostics and hypothesis testing
- Estimation of default probabilities based on empirical data
