''' Production of falsey objects.

    Provides a base class for creating objects that evaluate to ``False`` in
    boolean contexts. This functionality is useful for creating sentinel
    objects, absence indicators, and other specialized falsey types which need
    distinct identities and proper comparison behavior.
