# üîê DPJ - CLI Data Cryptographic Tool

**DPJ** is a command-line data encryption tool, an improvement of [Fixor](https://github.com/jheffat/-FiXOR) 2.50(Discontinued). The Name Fixor changed to DPJ 
 in honor of the my first encryption tool developed in QBasic and Visual Basic (2003‚Äì2007), DPJ is faster, AES-Like secure, and packed with new features designed to keep your data safe. Is a lightweight CLI tool, encrypt/decrypt files securely using custom-built methods. Good tool to encrypt your work projects or your sensitive data(documents, PDFs, photos, videos, etc.). -->‚ú® [Changelog](https://github.com/jheffat/DPJ/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## ‚ùìWhy the name change?

The original name, Fixor, was chosen because the first version of the tool used only XOR-based encryption with a fixed key in 2021. As the project evolved to include more advanced cryptographic mechanisms, the name no longer reflected its capabilities.

DPJ has a deeper significance: it was the name of my first encryption tool [DPJ Basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jheffat/DPJ/main/scrnsht/DPJ%20Basic%20by%20VB.png), created in 2001 with QBASIC(CLI), later in 2005 with VB(GUI). Bringing the name back honors that origin while also marking the maturity of this version.

This release marks a turning point ‚Äî DPJ is no longer a simple XOR tool, but a full encryption system with real IV, linear & nonlinear complexity...



## üßæ Features

- üîí **Fast Encrypt & Decrypt Files**, using custom-built encryption.
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Secure password input with masking** (hidden as you type).
- üåÄ **Nonlinear Transformation Support**, Integrated AES-like S-box, P-box, XOR mixing & byte inversion. Improves resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis.
- ‚ö° **IV Support**,  Uses a cryptographically secure IV to ensure ciphertext uniqueness, even with the same key and plaintext.
- üß† **Choose or Autogenerate Passphrase**, for encryption
- üö´ **No Overwrites**, a file will not be altered if the provided passphrase is incorrect. DPJ detects if a file is encrypted and prevents redundant encryption.
- üîê **KDF Support**, Passphrases are transformed via a `Key Derivation Function` before use, making brute-force attempts extremely difficult.
- üîë **Key Schedule Support**, a process that expands the main encryption key(KDF) into multiple round keys used throughout the encryption rounds to enhance security.
- üßÇ **Secure Password Hashing**, stored in encrypted metadata
- üß¨ **Encrypted Metadata with AES**, Used to protect internal config
- üîç **File Scan Mode**, to check encryption details
- ‚úÖ **Integrity Check Passed**, A SHA-256-based verification step checks whether the decrypted data matches the original, ensuring the decryption process was successful.
- üõ°Ô∏è **HMAC Support**, A SHA-256-based HMAC is generated during encryption and verified during decryption to detect tampering or corruption.
- #Ô∏è‚É£ **Hash tools included**, Hash files/Msg using any theses algorithms (blake2b, sha3_512, sha256, sha1,  sha512, shake_128, shake_256, sha3_256, blake2s, md5), In the absence of a specified algorithm, the default SHA256 will be applied.

## ‚ò†Ô∏èPlease Note!
I‚Äôm using a custom-built encryption scheme that applies multilayer linear and nonlinear transformations. Many of these layers are inspired by real-world cryptographic algorithms such as AES (see more in CHANGELOG.md).However üò±, it has not yet been reviewed by a professional cryptographer. For now, this option is intended for educational purposes only until it can be professionally reviewed. I‚Äôm currently rebuilding DPJ to support AES encryption as a second option, offering a more secure and reliable method widely used in both industry and cybercrime. The reason I built this tool from scratch(without relying on external modules) is to deepen my understanding of how encryption works, enhance my learning, and improve my problem-solving skills.


## üöÄ Performance

DPJ improves on Fixor with significantly faster encryption and decryption processes, optimized for modern systems and large files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
**DPJ is an encryption tool intended for responsible use.**
By using this software, you acknowledge and accept the following:

-You are solely responsible for managing your passwords, keys, and encrypted data.

-If you lose or forget your passphrase, there is no way to recover your data.
This is by design, as DPJ does not store or transmit any recovery information.

-The author(s) of DPJ are not liable for any data loss, damage, or consequences resulting from misuse, forgotten credentials, or failure to follow best security practices.

**Use at your own risk.**

## üôå Acknowledgements
DPJ(Data protection Jeff), was my first encryption app crafted in QBasic(CLI) and Visual Basic(GUI) between 2003‚Äì2007. This project is a modern revival with more power, speed, and security, thanks to the powerful language PYTHON.
