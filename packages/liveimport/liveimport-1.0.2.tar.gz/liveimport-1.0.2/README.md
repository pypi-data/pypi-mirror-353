Automatically reload modified Python modules in notebooks and scripts.

## Overview

LiveImport eliminates the need to restart a notebook's Python server to
reimport code under development in external files.  Suppose you are maintaining
symbolic math code in ``symcode.py``, LaTex formatting utilities in
``printmath.py``, and a simulator in ``simulator.py``.  In the first cell of a
notebook, you might write

```python
import liveimport
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot

import symcode
from printmath import print_math, print_equations as print_eq
from simulator import *

liveimport.register(globals(),"""
import symcode
from printmath import print_math, print_equations as print_eq
from simulator import *
""", clear=True)
```

Then, whenever you run cells, LiveImport will reload any of ``symcode``,
``printmath``, and ``simulator`` that have changed since registration or their
last reload.  LiveImport deems a module changed when its source file
modification time changes.

LiveImport also updates imported module symbols.  For example, if you modify
``printmath.py``, LiveImport will reload ``printmath`` and bind ``print_math``
and ``print_eq`` in the global namespace to the new definitions.  Similarly, if
you update ``simulator.py``, LiveImport will create or update bindings for
every public symbol in ``simulator`` â€” that is, every symbol defined in the
module that does not start with ``_``, unless there is an ``__all__`` property
defined for the module, in which case it acts on only those symbols, just like
``from simulator import *``.

Modules referenced by registered import statements are called tracked modules.
LiveImport analyzes top-level import dependencies between tracked modules to
ensure reloading is consistent with those dependencies.  Suppose ``simulator``
imports ``symcode``.  Then, if you modify ``symcode.py``, LiveImport reloads
``simulator`` after it reloads ``symcode`` even if ``simulator.py`` has not
changed.  If you do modify both, LiveImport takes care to reload ``symcode``
first.

## Cell Magic

As an alternative to calling `register()`, LiveImport defines a cell magic
``%%liveimport`` which both executes the cell content and registers every
top-level import statement.  So, you could split the example cell above into
two, making the second

```python
%%liveimport --clear
import symcode
from printmath import print_math, print_equations as print_eq
from simulator import *
```

No `register()` call is required.  Unfortunately, Visual Studio Code and
possibly other environments do not analyze magic cell content, making
``%%liveimport`` use awkward.  However, there is a workaround: calling
`hidden_cell_magic(enabled=True)` causes ``#_%%liveimport`` lines at the
beginning of cells to act just like ``%%liveimport`` when the cell is run, and
since ``#_%%liveimport`` is a Python comment, Visual Studio Code and other
environments do analyze the content.

A complete cell magic example equivalent to the first begins with cell

```python
import liveimport
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
liveimport.hidden_cell_magic(enabled=True)
```

which is followed by cell

```python
#_%%liveimport --clear
import symcode
from printmath import print_math, print_equations as print_eq
from simulator import *
```

## Outside of Notebooks

You can use LiveImport outside of notebooks, but in that case, you must call
`sync()` to check for out of date imports.  You can also disable automatic
syncing in a notebook by calling `auto_sync(enabled=False)` and rely on
explicit syncing instead.

## Documentation

For more details including an API reference see
[liveimport.readthedocs.io](https://liveimport.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

You can install LiveImport from PyPI with

```sh
$ pip install liveimport
```

You can also clone the repository and install it directly.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/escreven/liveimport.git
$ cd liveimport
$ pip install .
```

LiveImport requires Python 3.10 or greater and IPython 7.23.1 or greater.

## Reliability

LiveImport includes automated tests with 100% code coverage, which are run on
MacOS, Linux, and Windows with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 using both the
oldest supported and latest versions of IPython.  Notebook integration features
are tested using notebook 5.7.0 and notebook latest.  See [the GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/escreven/liveimport/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml)
for details.

If you have a copy of the source, you can run the tests yourself with

```sh
$ python test/main.py
```
