    "# BrainIndexer Basic Tutorial with Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "BrainIndexer is the best choice for indexing and querying large circuits. It provides support for soma, segment and synapse circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you confused about all of this? Let's start from the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you need to look into your circuit and find all the elements that are present in a certain region of space. This region, in BrainIndexer, could be a 3D box or a sphere.\n",
    "First of all we need to \"index\" the circuit. The indexing is a process in which we reorganize the content of the circuit so that it's much easier and quicker to look into. The indexing needs to be performed in order for BrainIndexer to run \"queries\" i.e. interrogate the circuit for the presence of elements in a certain region of space. The good news is that we need to run the indexing **only once**, then we can save it to disk so it can be loaded much faster in future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the circuit has been indexed, we can perform queries on it by specifying the coordinates of the vertices of the 3D box where we want to find elements. You can also perform \"proximity queries\" i.e. find all the elements that are close to a certain point. In that case we need to specify the coordinates of the center and the radius of the sphere around it in which we want to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll go through the entire process of setting up BrainIndexer, index a circuit and then perform some queries. What will be shown here is just the typical BrainIndexer workflow but keep in mind that there's much more you can do with it. For that we point you to the [official BrainIndexer documentation](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/documentation/projects/brain-indexer/latest/intro.html) and the examples in the `example` folder of the BrainIndexer repo.\n",

    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using the `module load` command to load and setup BrainIndexer. This is the recommended way to use BrainIndexer on BB5 but you can also install it using `pip`, using `spack` or just by downloading and compiling the code yourself and creating your Python virtual environment.
