## 🚨 The Hidden Cost of Bad Data

**Your AI agent works perfectly in development. Then it hits production data and crashes.**

Common failure scenarios:
- 💸 Missing currency codes → Multi-million dollar invoice errors
- 📧 Invalid emails → Customer service disruptions
- 🚚 Inconsistent addresses → Costly logistics mistakes

**The truth**: High agent reliability requires high data reliability. You can't achieve one without the other.

## 🚀 5-Minute Quickstart: See Your Agent's Crash Risk

```bash
# Install
pip install adri

# Run crash test on sample data
cd quickstart && python quickstart.py
```

**What you'll see in 5 minutes:**
```
✨ ADRI Score Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Score: 68/100 ❌
Status: Will Crash Agents

💥 Critical Issues Found:
• Invalid emails → Email agents will fail
• Missing currency → Invoice processing errors
• Date chaos → Scheduling failures
```

**[→ Full 5-Minute Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md)**

## 💡 The Solution: Prevent Crashes Before They Happen

Add one line to protect any agent:

```python
from adri.integrations.guard import adri_guarded

@adri_guarded(min_score=80)
def process_customer(data):
    # Your agent logic here
    send_email(data['email'])
    process_payment(data['amount'], data['currency'])
    
# If data quality < 80, the function won't run
# No more crashes! 🛡️
```

## 📊 The Reliability Relationship

| Data Reliability | Agent Capability | What You Can Build |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Low | Limited | Internal tools only |
| Medium | Moderate | Customer-facing with human backup |
| High | Advanced | Automated workflows |
| **Very High** | **Full** | **Mission-critical AI agents** |

**Small improvements in data reliability enable exponentially more use cases.**

## 🎯 How ADRI Works

### 1. Define Requirements First
```yaml
# invoice-processor.adri.yaml
name: Invoice Processing Agent
requires:
  completeness:
    critical_fields: [invoice_number, amount, currency, date]
    min_score: 95
  validity:
    formats:
      date: ISO8601
      amount: decimal(10,2)
    min_score: 98
```

### 2. Data Suppliers Know What to Build
```python
# Any data source can target the standard
from adri import DataSourceAssessor

assessor = DataSourceAssessor()
result = assessor.assess_file("my_data.csv")
print(f"Data quality score: {result.overall_score}/100")
```

### 3. Agents Trust Their Inputs
```python
# Agents can require compliant data
from adri import adri_guarded

@adri_guarded(min_score=80)
def process_invoices(data_source):
    # Agent knows data meets requirements
    return execute_with_confidence(data_source)
```

### 4. True Marketplace Emerges
- **Data providers** compete on quality scores
- **Agent builders** can target any ADRI data
- **Enterprises** mix and match components
- **Innovation** happens at every layer

## ⚡ See It In Action

### For Data Teams: "What Standard Do I Need to Meet?"
```bash
# Assess your data against a standard
adri assess invoices.csv --standard invoice-processor-v1

# Get specific remediation steps
📊 Assessment Report:
✗ Completeness: 76% (FAIL - requires 95%)
  Missing: currency in 24% of records
  Action: Add currency codes to all records

✓ Validity: 98% (PASS)
```

### For AI Engineers: "What Data Can I Trust?"
```python
# Discover compatible data sources
available_sources = adri.find_sources("invoice-processor-v1")
# Returns: ["warehouse.invoices", "erp.billing", "api.invoices"]

# Use any compliant source
for source in available_sources:
    my_agent.process(source)  # They all just work!
```

### For Enterprises: "Show Me the Ecosystem"
Visit the [ADRI Marketplace](https://adri.dev/marketplace) to find:
- 📦 **Certified Data Sources** by industry
- 🤖 **Compatible Agents** for your data
- 📋 **Standard Templates** for common use cases
- 🔧 **Implementation Partners** for support

## 🏗️ The Standard Components

### 1. Five Universal Dimensions
Every ADRI assessment measures:
- **Validity**: Is the data in the right format?
- **Completeness**: Are required fields present?
- **Freshness**: Is the data recent enough?
- **Consistency**: Does the data contradict itself?
- **Plausibility**: Does the data make business sense?

### 2. Industry Templates
Pre-built standards for common use cases:
```
adri-finance-invoice-v1
adri-retail-inventory-v1
adri-healthcare-patient-v1
adri-logistics-shipment-v1
```

### 3. Scoring System
- 0-100 score per dimension
- Pass/fail thresholds per use case
- Clear remediation guidance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install the Reference Implementation
```bash
pip install adri
```

### Try It on Sample Data
```bash
# Download a sample invoice dataset
curl -O https://adri.dev/samples/invoices.csv

# See what standards it could meet
adri discover invoices.csv

# Assess against a specific standard
adri assess invoices.csv --standard invoice-processor-v1
```

### Build Your First Compliant Pipeline
```python
from adri import adri_guarded

# Define your pipeline
@adri_guarded(min_score=70)
def load_invoice_data():
    data = pd.read_csv("raw_invoices.csv")
    # Add any transformations
    return data

# Now any agent can trust this data
compliant_data = load_invoice_data()
```
