This module adds two fields to contacts, to display the date of their last
invoice and their last bill (if any). It only takes into account posted
invoices and bills, and credit notes are not excluded.

It is useful to have this information at hand, for example when you want see
if contacts have been actively invoiced, or if on the contrary they have
not been invoiced for a long time, which may indicate that they are not active
anymore.
