- **Extensible**: add your own challenges in JSON

---

## Getting Started

## Method 1: Install via pip
### 1. Install Requirements
Install nyxbox via pip.
```bash
pip install nyxbox
```
Make sure you have clang++ or g++ installed, or Node.js for JavaScript if planning on using these langs, as NyxBox uses these to run your challenges written in C++ or JS. Same goes for Java (any jdk works! working on adding custom paths so it doesn't matter where you install it)

### 2. Run the App
```bash
nyxbox
```
## Method 2: Install via git

Clone git repo and cd.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisiscid/NyxBox
cd NyxBox
```

Then, run as a module.

```bash
python3 -m nyxbox.main
```
## Adding challenges
Add new challenges in the form of a JSON in the challenges directory. Challenges will not work if they do not follow the style of pre-made challenges.

## Notes
- Python 3.10+ recommended (The dev is running 3.12.1)
- C++, C, and Java runners require system dependencies. If they error out, make sure you have those installed first. (look above dummy)
- Run in a terminal supporting Unicode and colors like [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), or others.
