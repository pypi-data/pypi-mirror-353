"""Auto-generated API resources grouped by swagger tags.

This package contains resource classes that are automatically generated
from the OpenAPI/Swagger specification. Each resource corresponds to a
tag in the swagger spec and contains methods for all endpoints with that tag.

Resources are generated dynamically at runtime, so this package may appear
empty in the source code.
