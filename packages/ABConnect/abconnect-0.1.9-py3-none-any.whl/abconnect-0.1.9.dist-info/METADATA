```

For more detailed installation instructions and documentation, visit [https://abconnecttools.readthedocs.io/](https://abconnecttools.readthedocs.io/)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

ABConnect requires the following environment variables for authentication:

```bash
# Create a .env file with your credentials
ABCONNECT_USERNAME=your_username
ABCONNECT_PASSWORD=your_password
ABC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ABC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Optional: Set environment (defaults to production)
ABC_ENVIRONMENT=staging  # or 'production'
```

### Using Different Environments

ABConnect supports both staging and production environments:

```python
from ABConnect.api import ABConnectAPI

# Use staging environment
api = ABConnectAPI(env='staging')

# Use production environment (default)
api = ABConnectAPI()

# Environment can also be set via ABC_ENVIRONMENT variable
```

### Testing Configuration

For testing, create a `.env.staging` file with staging credentials:

```bash
cp ABConnect/dotenv.sample .env.staging
# Edit .env.staging with your staging credentials
```

Tests will automatically use `.env.staging` when running with pytest.
