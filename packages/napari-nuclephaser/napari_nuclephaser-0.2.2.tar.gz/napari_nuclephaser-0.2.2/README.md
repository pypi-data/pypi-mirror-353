A Napari plugin for automated cell nuclei detection, proliferation and population growth analysis, and single-cell tracking in brightfield and fluorescent nuclei timelapse microscopy images.

napari-nuclephaser is an open-source Napari plugin designed for scientists who need to measure cell proliferation rates, analyze population growth, and perform individual cell tracking on timelapse microscopy images. It utilizes [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) YOLO object detection models and [obss/sahi](https://github.com/obss/sahi) sliced inference methods to detect cell nuclei on brightfield and fluorescent images of any size, including large whole slide ones. Learn more with [documentation](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.13.653705v1).

## Nuclei detection

We trained a series of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models to detect nuclei on phase contrast images. It can be used for counting cells or for individual cell tracking (using nuclei detections as tracking markers). Prominent features of this approach are:
- Napari-nuclephaser plugin includes [obss/sahi](https://github.com/obss/sahi) functionality, allowing detection on images of arbitrary sizes.

- YOLO models are fast, providing reasonable inference speed even with CPU.
- Ability to predict and automatically count nuclei on stacks of images, making it convenient for cell population growth studies and individual cell tracking.

- Calibration algorithm that allows measuring accuracy for each specific use case.

## Calibration algorithm

Result of object detection model inference is highly dependent on _confidence threshold_ parameter.

</p>

We created several calibration (finding optimal confidence threshold) algorithms that allow adjusting models to specific use cases (cell types, magnifications, illumination settings, cameras etc.):
- Calibration using known number of objects on an image. Doesn't produce accuracy metrics.
- Calibration using fluorescent nuclei stain image (for example, DAPI image). Produces accuracy metrics.
- Calibration using manual annotation of nuclei. Produces accuracy metrics.

Apart from optimal confidence threshold search, these algorithms return accuracy metrics for specific use cases. Given that the calibration image is large, only part of it is used for search of threshold, while the second part is used for evaluation model's accuracy.
Accuracy metrics are [Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) and prediction-ground truth scatterplot, which shows how well model performs with different densities of cells.

## Cell Proliferation Measurement & Population Growth Analysis

With NuclePhaser you can reconstruct population growth curves from timelapse images of growing cell population by counting number of nuclei on each image. Key features of this approach are:

- No special equipment, reagents or dyes required, only regular culture plastic and cell growth medium, microscope with mechanical stage and a PC (even without GPU).
- [Accuracy measurement for each specific use case](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/General%20information/Confidence%20threshold%20calibration.html), so you will be sure the tool is working with appropriate precision.
- Measuring the number of cells, not the area occupied by cells, which can be significantly influenced by spreading/narrowing of cells. 
- Complete reproducibility of results with metadata.txt files saved for each experiment.

## Individual cell tracking

NuclePhaser can be used as an assistant for individual cells tracking. This task is extremely difficult, and manual tracking is still the only method with 100% proof against false tracks. With NuclePhaser, you can significantly simplify manual tracking: instead of marking each cell on each image, you can predict nuclei location with NuclePhaser and then correct the result, which is **much** faster. Learn more in [documentation](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Biological%20tasks%20guidelines/Individual%20cells%20tracking.html).
