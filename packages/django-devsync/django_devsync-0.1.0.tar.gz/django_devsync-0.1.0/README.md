# 🛠️ django-devsync

A tiny command-line tool that mimics `synchronize: true` from TypeORM — but for Django.

⚠️ **Strictly for development use. Never use in production.**

---

## 🚀 What It Does

In early-stage development, database schemas change fast and migrations get messy. `django-devsync` helps you:

- 🧹 **Delete all migration files**
- 💥 **Reset your local DB schema**
- 🔄 **Run `makemigrations` and `migrate` from scratch**

All with a single command.

---

## 🛑 Don't Use In Production

This tool **WILL destroy data** and has minimal safeguards.

You’ve been warned 🧨

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install django-devsync
```

---

## 💻 Usage

```bash
devsync --delete_migrations --reset_db --run_sync
```

or

```bash
python -m django_devsync --delete_migrations --reset_db --run_sync
```

If no flags are passed, it runs **all steps**.

### Flags

| Flag                  | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--delete_migrations` | Delete all `.py` and `.pyc` files in `migrations/` directories     |
| `--reset_db`          | Drop all tables/schemas in your local DB (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL) |
| `--run_sync`          | Run `makemigrations` and `migrate`                                 |

## 📂 Example

```bash
devsync
```

or

```bash
python -m django_devsync
```

Output:

```
🔧 No specific flags passed — running ALL steps:
• Deleting all migrations
• Resetting the database
• Running makemigrations and migrate

✅ All done!

```

## ⚙️ Supported Databases

- SQLite
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

> Uses Django's `DATABASES['default']['ENGINE']` to detect backend.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Prompts for your `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` (unless set in env)
- Verifies `DEBUG=True` before proceeding
- Uses Django internals: `call_command("makemigrations")`, etc.
- Drops and recreates schemas/tables directly with SQL
