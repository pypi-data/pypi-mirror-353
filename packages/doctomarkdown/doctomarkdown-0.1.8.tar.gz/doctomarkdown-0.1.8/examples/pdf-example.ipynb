    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the DocToMarkdown library to convert PDF documents to Markdown using different types of API clients. It showcases both extraction with and without LLM (Large Language Model) support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported API Clients in this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Groq API Client**: Use Groq's LLM for PDF-to-Markdown conversion.\n",
    "- **Gemini API Client**: Use Google's Gemini Vision model for advanced extraction.\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI Client**: Use Azure-hosted OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4o) for document conversion.\n",
    "- **Ollama API Client**: Use local or remote Ollama models via OpenAI-compatible API.\n",
    "- **No LLM (Standard Extraction)**: Extracts text and images using only local libraries (fitz) without any LLM.\n",

    "Each section below provides example code for initializing and using these clients with DocToMarkdown."
