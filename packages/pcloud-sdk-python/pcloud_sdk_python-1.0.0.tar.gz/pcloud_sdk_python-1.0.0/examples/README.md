## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install the pCloud SDK:**
   ```bash
   pip install pcloud-sdk
   ```

2. **Have pCloud account credentials ready:**
   - Your pCloud email and password, OR
   - pCloud app credentials (for OAuth2 examples)

### Running Examples

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Start with the basic example
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Try the comprehensive demo
python examples/complete_demo.py

# Explore progress tracking
python examples/progress_examples.py
```

### Authentication Methods

The examples support two authentication methods:

#### 1. Direct Login (Email/Password)
Most examples will prompt for your pCloud email and password:
```
üìß Enter your pCloud email: your-email@example.com
üîë Enter your password: ********
```

#### 2. Environment Variables
Set these to avoid repeated prompts:
```bash
export PCLOUD_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export PCLOUD_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

#### 3. OAuth2 (Production Apps)
For the OAuth2 example, you'll need app credentials:
1. Register at [pCloud API](https://docs.pcloud.com/)
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Update the credentials in `oauth2_example.py`

- Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- Implement proper token rotation for long-running applications
- Follow the security practices demonstrated in `token_management.py`

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify your email/password
   - Try different server locations (US vs EU)
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure pCloud SDK is installed: `pip install pcloud-sdk`
   - Use Python 3.7 or later

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Check file permissions for token storage
   - Ensure write access to temporary directories

4. **Network Issues**
   - Some examples create local servers (OAuth2)
   - Check firewall settings for port 8080
