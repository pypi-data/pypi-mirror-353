## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

Here's how to use the pCloud SDK for Python:

#### Basic usage:
```python
from pcloud_sdk import PCloudSDK

sdk = PCloudSDK("", "")  # Required empty strings
sdk.login("email@example.com", "password", location_id=2)
# Manual reconnection required
```

#### Recommended way:
```python
from pcloud_sdk import PCloudSDK

sdk = PCloudSDK()  # Zero configuration
sdk.login("email@example.com", "password")
# Automatic reconnection with token manager
```

#### New Features Usage:
```python
from pcloud_sdk import PCloudSDK
from pcloud_sdk.progress_utils import create_progress_bar

sdk = PCloudSDK()
sdk.login("email@example.com", "password")

# Upload with progress tracking
progress = create_progress_bar("Upload")
sdk.file.upload("file.txt", progress_callback=progress)

# Next time - instant connection!
sdk = PCloudSDK()
sdk.login()  # Uses saved token automatically
```

### Breaking Changes
- None! This is the initial release

### Deprecated Features
- None for initial release
- US servers as default (EU is now default, but US still supported)

### Recommended Updates
1. Remove empty strings from `PCloudSDK("", "")` � `PCloudSDK()`
2. Remove manual `location_id=2` parameter (now default)
3. Add progress callbacks for better user experience
4. Remove manual reconnection logic (now automatic)
