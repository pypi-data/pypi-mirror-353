voyage plugin for embcli, a command-line interface for embeddings.

## Reference

- [VoyageAI Text Embeddings](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings)
- [VoyageAI Multimodal Embeddings](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/multimodal-embeddings)

## Installation

```bash
pip install embcli-voyage
```

## Quick Start

You need VoyageAI API key to use this plugin. Set `VOYAGE_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file in the current directory. Or you can give the env file path by `-e` option.

```bash
cat .env
VOYAGE_API_KEY=<YOUR_VOYAGE_KEY>
```

### Try out the Embedding Models

```bash
# show general usage of emb command.
emb --help

# list all available models.
emb models
VoyageEmbeddingModel
    Vendor: voyage
    Models:
    * voyage-3-large (aliases: )
    * voyage-3.5 (aliases: )
    * voyage-3.5-lite (aliases: )
    * voyage-3 (aliases: )
    * voyage-3-lite (aliases: )
    * voyage-code-3 (aliases: )
    * voyage-finance-2 (aliases: )
    * voyage-law-2 (aliases: )
    * voyage-code-2 (aliases: )
    Model Options:
    * input_type (str) - Type of the input text. Options: 'None', 'query', 'document' Defaults to 'None'.
    * truncation (bool) - Whether to truncate the input texts to fit within the context length. Defaults to True.
    * output_dimension (int) - The number of dimensions for resulting output embeddings.
    * output_dtype (str) - The data type for the embeddings to be returned. Options: float, int8, uint8, binary, ubinary. float is supported for all models. int8, uint8, binary, and ubinary are supported by voyage-3-large, voyage-3.5, voyage-3.5-lite, and voyage-code-3.
VoyageMultimodalEmbeddingModel
    Vendor: voyage
    Models:
    * voyage-multimodal-3 (aliases: voyage-mm-3)
    Model Options:
    * input_type (str) - Type of the input text. Options: 'None', 'query', 'document' Defaults to 'None'.
    * truncation (bool) - Whether to truncate the input texts to fit within the context length. Defaults to True.

# get an embedding for an input text by voyage-3 model.
emb embed -m voyage-3 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input text by voyage-3 model with input_type=query.
emb embed -m voyage-3 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o input_type query

# get an embedding for an input text by voyage-3-large model with output_dtype=binary.
emb embed -m voyage-3-large "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o output_dtype binary

# get an embedding for an image by voyage-multimodal-3 model.
# assume you have an image file named `gingercat.jpeg` in the current directory.
emb embed -m voyage-mm-3 --image gingercat.jpeg

# calculate similarity score between two texts by voyage-3 model. the default metric is cosine similarity.
emb simscore -m voyage-3 "The cat drifts toward sleep." "Sleep dances in the cat's eyes."

```

### Document Indexing and Search

You can use the `emb` command to index documents and perform semantic search. `emb` uses [`chroma`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) for the default vector database.

```bash
# index example documents in the current directory.
emb ingest-sample -m voyage-3 -c catcafe --corpus cat-names-en

# or, you can give the path to your documents.
# the documents should be in a CSV file with two columns: id and text. the separator should be comma.
emb ingest -m voyage-3 -c catcafe -f <path-to-your-documents>

# search for a query in the indexed documents.
emb search -m voyage-3 -c catcafe -q "Who's the naughtiest one?"
