Use Cases / Context
===================

In some manufacturing environments where procedures and master data
setup are not complete (such as during pre-mass-production phases),
there are often situations where you need to add extra components or
operations to already-produced products in order to reflect the actual
production situation.

Configuration
=============

1. Navigate to Manufacturing > Configuration > Settings.
2. Find and enable the 'Allow Same Product for Component and Finish'
   option to allow using the same product as both a component and a
   finished product in manufacturing orders.
