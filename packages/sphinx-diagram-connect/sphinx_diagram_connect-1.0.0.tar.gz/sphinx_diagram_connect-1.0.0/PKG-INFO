# Enhance Your Sphinx Documentation with Dynamic Diagram Links

## Unlock Seamless Navigation Between Diagrams and Documentation

`sphinx_diagram_connect` is a powerful [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) extension designed to create intelligent, clickable links within your [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) and [DrawIO](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-drawio/) diagrams. By automatically resolving `std:doc:` and `std:ref:` syntax, this extension allows you to effortlessly connect elements in your diagrams directly to relevant sections or components within your Sphinx documentation. This means enhanced navigation, improved information flow, and a more interactive experience for your readers.

### See It in Action: Dynamic References in PlantUML

Imagine clicking on a diagram element and being taken directly to its detailed explanation in your documentation. This is precisely what `sphinx_diagram_connect` enables.

![](https://mi-parkes.github.io/sphinx-diagram-connect/_images/refInPlantuml.png)

This example demonstrates how `std:doc:` and `std:ref:` syntax within your PlantUML code becomes a live hyperlink in your rendered documentation:

```rst
.. uml::
    :caption: PlantUML Caption with **bold** and *italic*
    :name: PlantUML Label2

    @startmindmap mindmap2

    *[#Orange] Example of clickable references
    **[#lightgreen] [[ ":ref:`Heading 2`" Internal Page Arbitrary Reference1 ]]
    **[#lightblue] [[ ":ref:`N_00002`" Internal Page Arbitrary Reference2 on sphinx-needs ]]
    **[#lightgrey] [[ ":doc:`Test PlantUML 3`" Internal Page Reference3 ]]

    @endmindmap
```
