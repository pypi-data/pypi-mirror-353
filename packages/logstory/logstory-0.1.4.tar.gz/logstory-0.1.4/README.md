# Logstory

Logstory is used to update timestamps in telemetry (i.e. logs) and then replay them into a [Google Security Operations (SecOps)](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-operations?hl=en) tenant. Each usecase tells an infosec story, a "Log Story."

## Usecases

The stories are organized as "usecases", which always contain events and may contain [entities](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/ingestion/ingestion-entities), [reference lists](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/reference-lists), and/or [YARA-L 2.0](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/detection/yara-l-2-0-overview) Detection Rules. Each usecase includes a README.md file to describe its use.

Only the RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP is included with the PyPI package. Learning about and installing addition usecases is described in [usecases](https://github.com/chronicle/logstory/blob/main/docs/usecase_docs/ReadMe.md).

## Installation

Logstory has a command line interface (CLI), written in Python, that is most easily installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
$ pip install logstory
```

The `logstory` CLI interface has subcommands, which take arguments like so:
```
logstory usecase_replay RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP
```

These are explained in depth later in this doc.

## Configuration

After the subcommand, Logstory uses Google's [Abseil](https://abseil.io/docs/python/quickstart.html) library for parameterization of the CLI (aka "flags"). Once installed, it is easiest to configure the CLI flags in an [Abseil flagfile](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/flags#a-note-about---flagfile) like this one:

```
logstory usecase_replay RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP \
--customer_id=01234567-0123-4321-abcd-01234567890a \
--credentials_path=/usr/local/google/home/dandye/.ssh/malachite-787fa7323a7d_bk_and_ing.json \
--timestamp_delta=1d  # optional
```

### Customer ID

(Required) This is your Google SecOps tenant's UUID4, which can be found at:

https://${code}.backstory.chronicle.security/settings/profile

### Credentials Path

(Required)  The credentials provided use the [Google Security Operations Ingestion API](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/ingestion-api). This is *NOT* the newer RESTful v1alpha Ingestion API (yet, but that is future work).

**Getting API authentication credentials**

"Your Google Security Operations representative will provide you with a Google Developer Service Account Credential to enable the API client to communicate with the API."[[reference](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/ingestion-api#getting_api_authentication_credentials)]


**Update:** you can now download the ingestion authentication file from your SecOps tenant's settings page:

https://${code}.backstory.chronicle.security/settings/collection-agent

### Timestamp BTS

(Optional, default=1d) Updating timestamps for security telemetry is tricky. The .log files in the usecases have timestamps in many formats and we need to update them all to be recent while simultaneously preserving the relative differences between them. For each usecase, Logstory determines the base timestamp "bts" for the first timestamp in the first logfile and all updates are relative to it.


The image below shows that original timestamps on 2023-06-23 (top two subplots) were updated to 2023-09-24, the relative differences between the three timestamps on the first line of the first log file before (top left) and the last line of the logfile (top right) are preserved both interline and intraline on the bottom two subplots. The usecase spans an interval of 5 minutes and 55 seconds both before and after updates.

### Timestamp Delta

When timestamp_delta is set to 0d (zero days), only year, month, and day are updated (to today) and the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are preserved. That hour may be in the future, so when timestamp_delta is set to 1d the year, month, and day are set to today minus 1 day and the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are preserved.

**Tip:** For best results, use a cron jobs to run the usecase daily at 12:01am with `--timestamp_delta=1d`.


You may also provide `Nh` for offsetting by the hour, which is mainly useful if you want to replay the same log file multiple times per day (and prevend deduplication). Likewise, `Nm` offsets by minutes. These can be combined. For example, on the day of writing (Dec 13, 2024)`--timestamp_delta=1d1h1m` changes an original timestamp from/to:
```
2021-12-01T13:37:42.123Z1
2024-12-12T12:36:42.123Z1
```

The hour and minute were each offset by -1 and the date is the date of execution -1.


## Flags and flag files

Assuming your flagfile is named config.cfg, you can use it to define all of the required flags and then invoke with:

```
logstory usecase_replay_logtype RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP POWERSHELL --flagfile=config.cfg
```

That updates timestamps and all uploads from a single logfile in a single usecase. The following updates timestamps and uploads only entities (rather than events) from and overrides the timestamp_delta in the flagfile (if it is specified):

```
logstory usecase_replay_logtype RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP POWERSHELL \
 --flagfile=config.cfg \
 --timestamp_delta=0d \
 --entities
```

You can increase verbosity with by prepending the python log level:
```
PYTHONLOGLEVEL=DEBUG logstory usecase_replay RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP \
 --flagfile=config.cfg \
 --timestamp_delta=0d
```

For more usage, see `logstory --help`


## Usecases

Usecases are meant to be self-describing, so check out the metadata in each one.

**Tip:** It is strongly recommended to review each usecase before ingestion rather than importing them all at once.

As shown in the [ReadMe for the Rules Search Workshop](https://storage.googleapis.com/logstory-usecases-20241216/RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP/RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP.md),


If your usecases were distributed via PyPI (rather than git clone), they will be installed in `<venv>/site-packages/logstory/usecases`

You can find the absolute path to that usecase dir with:
```
python -c 'import os; import logstory; print(os.path.split(logstory.__file__)[0])'
/usr/local/google/home/dandye/miniconda3/envs/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/logstory
```

### Adding more usecases

We've chosen to distribute only a small subset of the available usecases. Should you choose to add more, you should read the metadata and understand the purpose of each one before adding them.


For the PyPI installed package, simply curl the new usecase into the `<venv>/site-packages/logstory/usecases` directory.

For example, first review the ReadMe for the EDR Workshop usecase:
https://storage.googleapis.com/logstory-usecases-20241216/EDR_WORKSHOP/EDR_WORKSHOP.md

Then download the usecase into that dir. For example:

```
gsutil rsync -r \
gs://logstory-usecases-20241216/EDR_WORKSHOP \
~/miniconda3/envs/pkg101_20241212_0453/lib/python3.13/site-packages/logstory/usecases/
```

To make that easier:
```
❯ logstory usecases_list_available

Available usecases in bucket 'logstory-usecases-20241216':
- EDR_WORKSHOP
- RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP
['EDR_WORKSHOP', 'RULES_SEARCH_WORKSHOP']
```

```
❯ logstory usecase_get EDR_WORKSHOP
