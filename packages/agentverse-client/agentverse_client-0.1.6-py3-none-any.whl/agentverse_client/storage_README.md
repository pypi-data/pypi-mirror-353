# storage
 The storage service is an Agentverse service that makes it easier for users and agents to transfer assets.  For this initial use case, we will not be support the agent to agent use case.  In this way, users of Agentverse can create assets and set permissions for these assets to other users.  Importantly only the User â†” [Agent] interactions are supported.  The user is always in control and must always create the asset which can the agents are interacting with.  This is an ephemeral storage engine, and is only expected to be used for short periods of time.
