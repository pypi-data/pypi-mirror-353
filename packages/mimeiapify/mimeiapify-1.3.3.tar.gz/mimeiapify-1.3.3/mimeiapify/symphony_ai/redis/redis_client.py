"""
Redis helper that is **fork-safe** and asyncio-native.

Why so elaborate?
-----------------
â€¢ Gunicorn / Uvicorn workers often `fork()` after import time.
  Re-using a parent-process connection in the child silently breaks
  pub/sub and can leak file descriptors.

â€¢ Each worker therefore needs its *own* connection-pool.

# RedisClient ðŸ”Œ

A fork-safe, asyncio-native helper that guarantees **one connection-pool per OS process**. 
Re-using the parent's TCP sockets after a `fork()` (common with Gunicorn / Uvicorn) breaks pub/sub; this wrapper avoids it.

```python
from symphony_concurrency.redis_client import RedisClient

# FastAPI lifespan
RedisClient.setup("redis://localhost:6379/0")

async with RedisClient.connection() as r:
    await r.publish("events", "hello")
```

setup(url) â€“ call once in every worker process. Safe re-entry.

get() â€“ returns the redis.asyncio.Redis instance; performs a cheap
PING health-check.

connection() â€“ async context-manager wrapper.

close() â€“ optional explicit pool shutdown during graceful
termination.

Default max_connections = 64. Tune via ConnectionPool kwargs if you
expect heavy pub/sub traffic.
