# Default Criticality Weights Configuration
# Copy this file and modify values to customize criticality scoring for your project

# Weight for degree centrality (incoming + outgoing connections normalized by graph size)
# Range: 0.0 - 1.0
# Higher values emphasize highly connected nodes
centrality_weight: 0.7

# Weight for call depth (maximum path length from entry points)
# Range: 0.0 - 1.0  
# Higher values emphasize nodes deeper in the call chain
depth_weight: 0.3

# Entry point patterns for call depth calculation
# These patterns identify functions/methods that serve as entry points
entry_point_patterns:
  - "main"
  - "test_*"
  - "*_handler"
  - "*_endpoint"
  - "*_view"
  - "handle_*"

# Normalization settings
normalization:
  # Maximum call depth for normalization (prevents extreme outliers)
  max_call_depth: 20
  
  # Minimum graph size for meaningful centrality calculation
  min_graph_size: 5

# Performance settings
performance:
  # Enable caching of criticality scores
  enable_caching: true
  
  # Cache invalidation on graph changes
  auto_invalidate_cache: true
  
  # Maximum nodes to process in single batch
  max_batch_size: 1000

# Debug settings
debug:
  # Log detailed scoring calculations
  verbose_logging: false
  
  # Export intermediate calculations for analysis
  export_intermediate_data: false
