bvbrc documentation
===================

Welcome to the documentation for :code:`bvbrc`!

The `Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC)`_ is an online
resource for research in bacterial and viral infectious disease. BV-BRC provides
a `Data API`_ that can be used to request data from BV-BRC in your own
workflows.

:code:`bvbrc` is a python package that is intended to make interacting with the
BV-BRC Data API within python code feel straightfoward and intuitive. Take a
look at the :doc:`quickstart <quickstart>` to get started!

Installation
------------

:code:`bvbrc` can be installed from PyPI using pip::

   pip install bvbrc

If you want to be able to convert the API responses to a :code:`pandas` or
:code:`polars` DataFrame, then you must also install the appropriate package:
