    Google does not natively handle translating of XML but does handle HTML.

    For blocks with XML definitions (e.g. problem blocks)

    For translations of blocks with XML definitions (e.g. Problem Block) we have to
    use the HTML translation mode of the Google Translate API. This is the closest we can
    currently get without native XML translation support.

    A "helpful" feature of this though is that the API does a fair amount of
    reformatting. For HTML, they remove invalid tag structures (like any tag inside
    of a <label>) as well as unquote single word attributes in tags. Our XML parser
    fails for unquoted attributes so this feature breaks several problem types.

    The workaround is to parse the translated XML as HTML and rewrite to string. The
    pair of parsers here re-quote the attributes we need quoted with the side effect
    of also wrapping the entire problem in HTML / Body tags, which we strip before
    returning.
