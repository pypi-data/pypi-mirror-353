# 3ETool

__3ETool__ contains some useful tools developed by the [SERG research group](https://www.dief.unifi.it/vp-177-serg-group-english-version.html) 
of the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) for performing exergo-economic and exergo environmental analysis. The __user manual__ can be downloaded [here](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/etapp-serggroup.appspot.com/o/3ETool_res%2FOther%2FUser%20Guide-eng.pdf?alt=media&token=db51ff1e-4c63-48b9-8b42-322a2eee44da). Moreover, some [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6A7PjCJLfa9xNOFwRc3D_XroWhKlptj) have been uploaded in order to help the user in compiling the excel file. 

### !!! NEW DRAG & DROP FUNCTIONALITY ü•≥üéâ!!! 
With the new drag & drop functionality, the user can simply define the topology 
using a graphical interface and then run the calculation starting from there.
to use this feature, the user has to run the following command:
```python
from EEETools import run_drag_drop_server
run_drag_drop_server()
```

This will run a server on the localhost, and the user can access it 
using the following link http://localhost:8002

### 1 - Calculation process ü§î‚öô
The beta version can be downloaded using __PIP__:
```
pip install 3ETool
```
Once the installation has been completed the user can import the tool, and paste to a desired location the __user manual__, the __components documentation__ or the __default excel file__, as in the _matlab version_ of the app.
```python
import EEETools

EEETools.paste_user_manual()
EEETools.paste_components_documentation()
EEETools.paste_default_excel_file()
```
Finally, once the Excel file has been compiled, the calculation can be initialized trough this command:
```python
import EEETools

EEETools.calculate()
```
calculation options and user defined excel path can be passed to the function as well (default values are _true_); in case user does not pass the path, the app will automatically open a filedialog window so that it can be selected manually
```python
import EEETools

EEETools.calculate(
    
    excel_path="your_excel_file.xlsx",
    calculate_on_pf_diagram = True, 
    loss_cost_is_zero = True, 
    valve_is_dissipative = True, 
    condenser_is_dissipative = True

)
```
### 2 - Debugging tools üë®‚Äçüíªüîç
Excel file can be debugged using some specific tools that can be launched using the following command (please select the 
Excel file that you want to debug on program request):
```python
import EEETools
EEETools.launch_connection_debug()
```
Another possible way of debugging the code is to ask the program to export the debug information on the Excel file:
```python
import EEETools
EEETools.export_debug_information()
```
Finally, topology can be displayed using:
```python
import EEETools
EEETools.launch_network_display()
```
### 3 - Sankey Diagrams üìàüìä
Sankey diagram can be plotted using the following command: 
```python
import EEETools
EEETools.plot_sankey(
    
    generate_on_pf_diagram=True,
    display_costs=True,

)
```
*   ___<span style="color:#3399ff">generate_on_pf_diagram</span>___ can be omitted and 
    __is <span style="color:#3399ff">True</span> by default__:
    
    - if __False__ the connections are defined according to the __physical topology__ of the plant 
    - if __True__ the connections are based on the __product-fuel__ definition


*   ___<span style="color:#3399ff">display_costs</span>___ can be omitted and 
    __is <span style="color:#3399ff">False</span> by default__:
    
    - if __False__ the thickness of the connection in the sankey diagram is proportional to the __exergy flux__ between 
    the components (in _kW_)
    
    - if __True__ the thickness of the connection in the sankey diagram is proportional to the 
    __economic (or environmental) flux__ between the components (in _‚Ç¨/s_ or in _Pts/s_). In addition, for each 
    connection, the __color intensity__ is proportional to the __relative cost of the stream__ (in _‚Ç¨/kJ_ or in _Pts/kJ_)


### 4 - Code Structure üìÅ

__The application code is divided into 3 main folders:__<br/><br/>
__MainModules__ directory contains Base modules such as _Block, Connection, ArrayHandler and Drawer Classes._<br/>
__Block Sublcasses__ contains a Block subclass for each component type (e.g. expander, compressor etc.)<br/>
__Tools__ contains different APIs needed for the program to run (e.g. the cost correlation handler, 
the EES code generator, and the importer and exporter for both Excel and xml files)
