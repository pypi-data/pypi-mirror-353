    Abstract class for PEC Handler models.
    This class defines the interface for PEC Handler models.
    The general goal of the model is to returns the cost in €/s for
    each component starting from the sum of the cost of the main
    component (PEC) of the system.

    The class will also have a method to define which are the required
    inputs to calculate the cost of the component. to be used by the frontend
    JSON app to display the user the required inputs to calculate the cost.
