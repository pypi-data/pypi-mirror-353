UAVLink is a V2X protocol extension designed for UAV networks. It integrates D2D communication to enable efficient UAV-to-UAV (U2U) interactions. With a sidechain mechanism, it supports mission coordination, location sharing, and route optimization, and is optimized for typical UAV scenarios such as high mobility, unstable channels, multi-hop communication, and energy constraints.
