# CTkSeparator
A customizable separator for `CustomTkinter`.

## Installation
```sh
pip install CTkSeparator
```

## Usages
Here are the parameters in CTkSeparator:

| Parameter      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `length`      | **Must be positive.** Defines how long the CTkSeparator is, regardless of orientation. |
| `line_weight` | **Must be positive.** Determines the thickness of the CTkSeparator. Defaults to 4 if not set. |
| `dashes`      | **Must be positive.** Specifies the number of dashes. If set to 1, it becomes a single solid line. |
| `fg_color`    | **Must be a string or tuple of strings.** Sets the color of the dashes. Accepts a tuple to create a gradient effect, transitioning smoothly between colors. |
| `corner_radius` | **Must be positive.** Defines the corner radius for each dash. |
| `orientation` | **Must be either `'horizontal'` or `'vertical'`.** Determines the direction of the CTkSeparator. |
| `gap`        | **Must be positive.** Controls the spacing between dashes. **Cannot be used with `dash_length`.** |
| `dash_length` | **Must be positive.** Specifies the width of the dashes. **Cannot be used with `gap`.** |


## Arguments
1. `configure` It is your normal configure function. It can configure any of your parameters in CTkSeparator.
2. `bind` The bind function attaches events to the separator, though behavior may vary depending on CustomTkinter's widget handling.

### Code Example

[Demo.py](https://github.com/AJ-cubes/CTkSeparator/blob/main/examples/demo.py)

```python
import customtkinter as ctk
from CTkSeparator import CTkSeparator


app = ctk.CTk()

above = ctk.CTkLabel(master=app,
                     text="Above the CTkSeparator")
above.pack(pady=12, padx=10)
test_separator = CTkSeparator(master=app,
                              length=500,
                              line_weight=4,
                              dashes=10,
                              fg_color=("#FFFFFF", "#000000", "#FFFFFF"),
                              corner_radius=10,
                              orientation='horizontal',
                              gap=5)
test_separator.pack(pady=12, padx=10)
below = ctk.CTkLabel(master=app,
                     text="Below the CTkSeparator")
below.pack(pady=12, padx=10)
app.mainloop()
