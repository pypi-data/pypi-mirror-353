# AI Signal

![AI Signal Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guglielmo/ai-signal/main/docs/images/main.png)

Terminal-based AI curator that turns information noise into meaningful signal.

AI Signal is a powerful tool designed to help you regain control over your information diet in today's 
overwhelming digital landscape. While existing platforms and algorithms decide what content reaches you, 
AI Signal empowers you to define and implement your own content curation strategy.

By leveraging AI capabilities and your personal preferences, it transforms the constant 
stream of information into meaningful, relevant insights that matter to you. 
You define the categories, quality thresholds, and filtering criteria, ensuring that the content you consume 
aligns with your interests and goals.

Think of it as your personal content curator that works tirelessly to surface valuable information 
while filtering out noise, all running locally on your machine. 
With AI Signal, you're not just consuming content ‚Äì you're actively shaping how information reaches you, 
making conscious choices about what deserves your attention.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for more content sources (YT videos, podcasts, pdf)
- [ ] Add statistics on most used sources and categories 
  - which are the sources most interesting news come from?
  - which are the categories with most news
  - which are the trends
- [ ] Implement a double thresholds mechanism
  - all below minimal threshold is not even added to the datatable
  - all below maximum threshold is accepted as _interesting_
  - all in between must be further evaluated, by you, with your keyboard
    - y - accept
    - n - refuse
- [ ] Implement feedback loop, based on your selections
  - suggest other interests that you may have
  - highlight waning interests
- [ ] Implement custom AI models (Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini, ...)
