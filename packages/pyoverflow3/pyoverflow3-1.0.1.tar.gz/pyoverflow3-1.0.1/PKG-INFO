# pyoverflow3
Complete Rewrite of pyoverflow library from Python 2 to Python 3

A Python Library for Quick Debugging of Errors using StackOverflow
    
    A complete rewritten library in Python3 based on pyoverflow library which was based on Python2

## Supported Features
- Quick Search of errors on StackOverflow for Python

## Planned Features
Integration with other languages like:
- Java
- JavaScript
- C
- C++ and many more

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install pyoverflow3
```

## Getting Started

Import the package

```py
import pyoverflow3
```
Create a `.py` file and include try-except block where you may expect an error and pass the error and number of solutions into `pyoverflow3.submit_error(err_msg,no_solutions)`

Once an error gets generated, the library gets called and it instantly shows you possible solutions for your error.
