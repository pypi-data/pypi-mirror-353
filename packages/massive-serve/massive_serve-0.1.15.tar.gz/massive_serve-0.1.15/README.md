# Massive Serve User Guide

One command to download and serve a datastore---that's it 😎.

## Installation
```bash
pip install massive-serve --upgrade
```

## Usage
List of currently supported datastores can be found in [massive-serve collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/rulins/massive-serve-681a3d499212ccfcd07ebc16).
I will keep adding more domains and retriever combinations! Open an issue to request new datastores 😉.

To serve a demo datastore:
```bash
massive-serve serve --domain_name demo
```

To serve a wikipedia datastore:
```bash
massive-serve serve --domain_name dpr_wiki_contriever_ivfpq
```

Useful notes:
- To avoid manually specifying the data storage location (e.g., in slurm jobs), set the `DATASTORE_PATH` environment variable to your desired data directory.
- To specify the `nprobe` (default to 64, which defines how many clusters out of 2024 you'd like to performance search in IVF index), just add ``nprobe: XX`` in your curl request.


It will then download and serve the index and print the API and one example request in the terminal, e.g.,

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    MASSIVE SERVE SERVER                    ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Domain: demo                                               ║
║ Server: XXX                                                ║
║ Port:   XXX                                                ║
║ Endpoint: XXX@XXX:XXX/search                               ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝


Test your server with this curl command:

curl -X POST XXX@XXX:XXX/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Tell me more about the stories of Einstein.", "n_docs": 1, "domains": "demo"}'
```

### Send Requests
If the API has been served, you can either send single or bulk query requests to it.

**Bash Examples.**

```bash
# single-query request
curl -X POST <user>@<address>:<port>/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Where was Marie Curie born?", "n_docs": 1, "domains": "dpr_wiki_contriever"}'

# multi-query request
curl -X POST <user>@<address>:<port>/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": ["Where was Marie Curie born?", "What is the capital of France?", "Who invented the telephone?"], "n_docs": 2, "dpr_wiki_contriever": "MassiveDS"}'
```

**Python Example.**
```python
import requests

json_data = {
    'query': 'Where was Marie Curie born?',
    "n_docs": 20,
    "domains": "dpr_wiki_contriever"
}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Add 'http://' to the URL if it is not SSL/TLS secured, otherwise use 'https://'
response = requests.post('http://<user>@<address>:<port>/search', json=json_data, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

Example output of a multi-query request:
```json
{
  "message": "Search completed for '['Where was Marie Curie born?', 'What is the capital of France?', 'Who invented the telephone?']' from MassiveDS",
  "n_docs": 2,

# Massive Serve Developer Guide

## Environment Setup

### Using Conda (Recommended for GPU support)

1. Create a new conda environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RulinShao/massive-serve.git
cd massive-serve
conda env create -f conda-env.yml
conda activate massive-serve
```
To update the existing environment:
```bash
conda env update -n massive-serve -f conda-env.yml
```

## Upload new index

```bash
python -m massive_serve.cli upload-data --domain_name demo
```

Test serving the index:
```bash
python -m massive_serve.cli serve --domain_name demo
```

## Update package
Make sure the version in the `setup.py` has been updated to a different version. Then run:
```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ massive_serve.egg-info/
pip install build twine
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
Users can refresh their installed repo via:
```bash
pip install --upgrade massive-serve
```
