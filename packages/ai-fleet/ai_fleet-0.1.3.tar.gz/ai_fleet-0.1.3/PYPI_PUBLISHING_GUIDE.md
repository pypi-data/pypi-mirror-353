# Publishing AI Fleet to PyPI with uv

## Prerequisites

1. **Update pyproject.toml metadata** (âœ… Done)
   - Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual details
   - Update GitHub URLs to your repository

2. **Create a LICENSE file** (Required)
   ```bash
   # Create MIT LICENSE file (adjust based on your preference)
   cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'
   MIT License

3. **Create PyPI accounts**
   - Register at https://pypi.org/account/register/
   - Register at https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
   - Generate API tokens for both

## Step 1: Build the Package

```bash
# Build both source distribution and wheel
uv build --no-sources

# This creates files in dist/ directory:
# - ai_fleet-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
# - ai_fleet-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

## Step 2: Test on TestPyPI First

```bash
# Set your TestPyPI token
export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="your-test-pypi-token"

# Publish to TestPyPI
uv publish --publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

# Test installation from TestPyPI
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ ai-fleet
```

## Step 3: Publish to PyPI

```bash
# Set your PyPI token
export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="your-pypi-token"

# Publish to PyPI
uv publish
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Test that it can be installed
uv run --with ai-fleet --no-project -- fleet --version

# Or with pipx (recommended for CLI tools)
pipx install ai-fleet
fleet --version
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub Actions

For automated publishing, create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for trusted publishing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
      - name: Build package
        run: uv build --no-sources
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        run: uv publish
        env:
          UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Tips

1. **Version Management**: Update version in pyproject.toml before each release
2. **Testing**: Always test on TestPyPI first
3. **Tokens**: Use project-specific tokens, not account-wide tokens
4. **Retry**: If upload fails midway, run the same command again (PyPI ignores existing files)

## Troubleshooting

- **Token Issues**: Ensure token starts with `pypi-` and has correct permissions
- **Build Errors**: Run `uv build` without `--no-sources` to debug
- **Import Errors**: Check that all dependencies are listed in pyproject.toml
