## 🔒 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using VMManager 6 Auto-Balancer:

### Configuration Security
- **Never commit `.env` files** with credentials to version control
- **Use strong passwords** for VMManager accounts
- **Enable SSL/TLS verification** in production environments
- **Limit API user permissions** to minimum required for balancing operations
- **Rotate credentials regularly**

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all VMManager API communications
- **Implement firewall rules** to restrict API access
- **Consider VPN access** for management operations
- **Monitor API access logs** for suspicious activity

### Operational Security
- **Test in development** environment before production use
- **Use dry-run mode** for initial testing and verification
- **Monitor migration activities** through logs
- **Implement backup procedures** before making changes
- **Review exclusion lists** regularly to ensure they're current

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Responsible Disclosure
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums
3. **DO** report privately using one of the methods below

### Reporting Methods

#### GitHub Security Advisories
Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details

### What to Include
Please provide:
- **Vulnerability description** - What is the security issue?
- **Affected versions** - Which versions are impacted?
- **Attack scenario** - How could this be exploited?
- **Proof of concept** - Steps to reproduce (if safe to share)
- **Suggested fix** - If you have ideas for remediation
- **Your contact information** - For follow-up questions

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Based on severity (1-4 weeks)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### VMManager API Access
- This tool requires administrative API access to VMManager
- API credentials are used for authentication and all operations
- VM migrations require elevated privileges in VMManager

### Data Handling
- API responses may contain sensitive infrastructure information
- Logs may include node names, VM details, and configuration data
- No customer data or VM contents are accessed or modified

### Network Communications
- All API communications should use HTTPS/TLS
- SSL certificate verification can be disabled for development (not recommended for production)
- No data is transmitted to external services

### Local Storage
- Configuration files may contain sensitive credentials
- Log files may contain infrastructure details
- No persistent storage of sensitive data beyond configuration

## 🛠️ Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures
- **Input validation** for all configuration parameters
- **SSL/TLS support** for API communications
- **Dry-run mode** for safe testing without making changes
- **Permission checks** before attempting operations
- **Error handling** to prevent information disclosure
- **Secure credential handling** through environment variables

### Recommended Security Controls
- **Principle of least privilege** for API accounts
- **Network segmentation** between management and production networks
- **Audit logging** for all balancing activities
- **Regular security reviews** of configurations and exclusions
- **Backup and recovery procedures** for critical VMs

## 📋 Compliance Considerations

### Audit Trail
- All operations are logged with timestamps
- Migration decisions and results are recorded
- API calls and responses can be logged at DEBUG level

### Access Control
- Ensure API accounts have appropriate VMManager permissions
- Implement network-based access controls
- Consider multi-factor authentication for VMManager access

### Change Management
- Test configuration changes in development environments
- Document exclusions and special configurations
- Implement approval processes for production deployments

## 🚫 Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **No built-in encryption** for configuration files (use OS-level encryption)
- **No built-in authentication** beyond VMManager API credentials
- **No built-in authorization** controls beyond VMManager permissions
- **Debugging mode** may expose sensitive information in logs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use OS-level file system permissions to protect configuration files
- Implement network-level access controls
- Monitor and review log outputs before sharing
- Use dedicated service accounts with limited permissions
