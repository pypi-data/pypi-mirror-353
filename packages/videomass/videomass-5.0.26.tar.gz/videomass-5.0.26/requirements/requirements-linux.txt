# This installation method involves compiling Videomass from source distribution
# (sdist), so it also requires packages to build the binary (wheel).

# IMPORTANT! Before installing Videomass using this `requirements` file,
# make sure to install wxPython from your Linux distribution's package manager.
# This will prevent pip from attempting to build wxPython from source, as
# wxPython's PyPi wheels only provides support for Windows and MacOS.

# This assumes installation in a virtual environment using python3-venv module
# with `--system-site-package` option, like this:
#
#   ~$ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages --upgrade-deps VENV
#   ~$ source VENV/bin/activate
#   ~$ python3 -m pip install --no-binary videomass -r requirements-linux.txt
