Bit Numbering,Unnamed: 1
This spreadsheet labels bits and bytes with the zero bit/byte being the most-significant bit/byte (MSb/MSB)  (CCSDS and ITOS Convention),
"However, in FSW, the zero bit/byte is the least-significant bit (LSb) or least-significant byte (LSB)",
,
"Packet naming convention is: TYPE_NAME, where",
TYPE,"SCI, META, ENG, or DIAG"
NAME,Short descriptive name
,
,
"Telemetry mnemonic naming convention is: [LZ_]SS_COMP_DESC, where",
LZ,Level Zero Telemetry Item
SS,"Subsystem or Element:  ADCS, CDS, DDMI, EPS, FSW, SMT"
,
COMP,Component or other sub-subsystem identifier (e.g. HTR)
DESC,Short descriptive name and/or number
"However, packet header telemetry values and trailing checksums are named beginning with the packet short-name (e.g. ENG_HI)",
,
Telemetry APID Conventions (bit # is relative to start of the Packet Primary Header field),
Bits 5-8,Indicates packet type as follows:
1,Science
10,Science Meta-Data
11,Engineering
111,Super-Packet
1000,Diagnostic - General
1001,Diagnostic - ADCS
101x,Diagnostic - DDMI

Bits 9-15,Packet number (unique when paired with Bits 5-8)
,"When bits 5-7 are ""Diagnostic - DDMI"", bits 8-15 will be populated with the ""Packet ID"" of the SBPP message output by the DDMI.   (ref doc # 0216897)"
,"                  All DDMI telemetry will be available as ""raw ""RS-422 Packaged Packets, with packet names DDMI_RAW_0x580, DDMI_RAW_0x581, etc.."
