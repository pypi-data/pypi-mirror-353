[prep CDF-24745, CDF-24554, CDF-24555] ðŸ‘·Refactor Dump Command (#1592)

# Description

Stacked on #1591, #1589, #1588

Context: Toolkit supports dumping assets/timeseries to csv/parquet (and
yaml). This is the culmination of the three PRs mentioned above. It
moves out the pieces, writing to file, interactive select, looking up
metadata keys from the dump command. The goal to use these pieces in
other commands, as well as add support for dumping other resources that
are not asset centric.

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

### Improved

- The `cdf dump timeseries/assets` now has a standardized order for
columns.
- The `cdf dump timeseries/assets` now splits into multiple files if the
size is above 128MB.
- [performance] The `cdf dump timeseries/assets` no longer writes files
twice to ensure all columns are the same. Now, it looks up column
headers before starting the dump process.

## templates

No changes.
