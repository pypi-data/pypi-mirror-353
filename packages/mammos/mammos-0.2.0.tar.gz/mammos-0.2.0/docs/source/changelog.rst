follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__, the metapackage version is
updated according to the largest bump of any of the dependent packages.


0.2.0 -- 2025-06-06
===================

Added
-----

``mammos``
  - Command-line script ``mammos-fetch-examples`` to download all example
    notebooks.
``mammos-entity``  -- 0.6.0
  - Entity objects have ``ontology_label_with_iri`` attribute.
  - When trying to initialize an entity with a wrong unit the error message does
    now show the required unit defined in the ontology.

Fixed
-----

``mammos-entity``
  - ``Entity.to`` did not return a new entity in the requested units and instead
    used the default entity units.
  - ``Entity.axis_label``: unit inside parentheses instead of brackets.

0.1.0 -- 2025-06-05
===================

Added
-----

``mammos`` -- 0.1.0
  - Workflows for hard magnets and sensor shape optimization.
  - Ensures compatible software components are installed.
``mammos-analysis`` -- 0.1.0
  - Calculation of macroscopic properties (Mr, Hc, BHmax) from a hysteresis
    loop.
  - Fitting of the linear segment of a hysteresis loop.
  - Calculation of temperature-dependent micromagnetic properties from atomistic
    spin dynamics simulations using Kuzâ€™min equations.
``mammos-dft`` -- 0.3.0
  - Database lookup functionality for a selection of pre-computed materials.
``mammos-entity`` -- 0.5.0
  - Provides entities: quantities with links to the MaMMoS ontology (based on
    EMMO) by combining ``mammos-units`` and `EMMOntoPy
    <https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMOntoPy>`__.
  - Helper functions to simplify creation of commonly required magnetic entities.
``mammos-mumag`` -- 0.6.0
  - Finite-element hysteresis loop calculations.
  - Requires a separate installation of `esys-escript
    <https://github.com/LutzGross/esys-escript.github.io/>`__.
``mammos-spindynamics`` -- 0.2.0
  - Database lookup functionality for a selection of pre-computed materials.
``mammos-units`` -- 0.3.1
  - Extension of astropy.units that allows working with quantities (units with
    values) containing additional units relevant for magnetism.
