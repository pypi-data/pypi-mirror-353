## üì¶ **Installation**

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/6C656C65/pythonrunner.git
cd pythonrunner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install from package

```bash
pip install pyrunx
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

Pythonrunner requires a YAML configuration file. By default, it takes the `config.yml` or `config.yaml` file from the current directory.
Alternatively, you can use the `-c` or `--config` argument for the path to the file to use.
The file simply contains the variables that will be used in the extensions. Here is an example file:

```yml
crtsh:
  discord_token: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  discord_prefix: "!"

dns:
  discord_token: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  discord_prefix: "!"

rootme:
  discord_token: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  discord_prefix: "!"
  api_key: XXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  users_uid:
    - uid: 000000
      pseudo: user1
    - uid: 111111
      pseudo: user2
...
```

## üß© **Extensions**

Pythonrunner will launch the python files located in the `extensions` folder. The python files can be in subfolders of this folder.
You can use the `-e` or `--extensions` argument to change the path of the folder to read.

You can also use the `--only` argument to specify a comma-separated list of extension filenames (without `.py`) to load exclusively.
Example:
```bash
pythonrunner --only dns,crtsh
```
This will only load the dns.py and crtsh.py extensions.

Extensions are available on [this repository](https://github.com/6C656C65/pythonrunner-extensions).
Each of these extensions offers a configuration file. You can add the configurations to your file.

## üìö **Documentation**
