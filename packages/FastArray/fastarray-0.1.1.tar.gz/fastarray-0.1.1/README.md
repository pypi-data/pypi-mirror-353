# fastarray

**fastarray** is a fast, lightweight Python package for preprocessing geospatial optical imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) to prepare it for machine learning workflows. It simplifies operations like index computation (NDVI, NDWI, etc.), reprojection, patching, and transformation into PyTorch-ready tensorsâ€”while preserving geospatial coordinates.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Compute vegetation and water indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.)
- âœ… Read raster data into coordinate-aware arrays
- âœ… Clip and reproject rasters using geometries (e.g., GeoJSON or Shapely)
- âœ… Split imagery into fixed-size patches
- âœ… Convert to PyTorch tensors for ML pipelines
- âœ… Fully Pythonic (no heavy GDAL/C++ dependencies)
- âœ… Fast and async-friendly where possible
