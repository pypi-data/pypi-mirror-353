           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# BANG - BooleAn Networks on the GPU

BANG is a Python package dedicated to analysis, simulation, and control of Boolean networks with the help of CUDA.

## Table of Contents

- [Features](#features)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)

## Features

- **High-performance simulation**: GPU-accelerated computations for Boolean network simulations.
- **Effective block-based attractor detection (PBN)**: Efficiently find attractors in large networks.
- **Visualization**: Built-in support for visualizing network dynamics.
- **Parsing**: Easy-to-use parsing of PBNs from ASSA-PBN and SBML formats.

## Installation

BANG is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher.

```bash
pip install bang-gpu
```

For the latest development version, you can clone the repository and install it manually. First you need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zpp20/bang.git
cd bang
```

Now, you can install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

### 1. Creating a Boolean Network

You can define a Boolean network using a set of parameters of a Probabilistic Boolean Network. For example:

```python
from bang import PBN

pbn = PBN(
    # number of nodes
    3, 
    # number of functions
    [1, 1, 1],
    # number of parents in functions
    [2, 2, 1], 
    # functions
    [[True, True, True, False], [False, True, False, False], [True, False]],
    # indexes of the parents in the functions
    [[0, 1], [0, 1], [1]],
    # probabilities that the functions are chosen
    [[1.0], [1.0], [1.0]],
    # probability of a random perturbation at any step
    0.0,
    # initial state
    [3],
)
```

### 2. Simulating how the network evolves

Run a simulation for a specified number of steps:

```python
# Set the initial state (otherwise the default is all False)
pbn.set_initial_state([[True, False, True]])

# Simulate the network for 10 steps
pbn.simple_steps(10)

# Access the simulation history
print("Trajectory history:", pbn.history)
# Access the final state
print("Last state:", pbn.last_state)
```

### 3. Using CPU-Based simulation

If you want to run the simulation on the CPU instead of the GPU:

```python
# Simulate the network on the CPU for 10 steps
pbn.simple_steps(n_steps=10, device="cpu")
```

### 4. Detecting attractors

To detect attractors in the network, you can use the `attractor_detection` method:

```python
# Detect attractors in the network using the block-based method
attractors = pbn.blocks_detect_attractors()
print("Attractors found:", attractors)
```

### 5. Visualization

You can visualize the state transitions of the network:

```python
# Plot the evolution of the trajectory simulated in the 1st thread
pbn.trajectory_graph(1)
```

## Development

### Setup

The easiest way to set up all the necessary development dependencies is to use `pip` with the `dev` extras:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Code quality

BANG uses `black` for code formatting and `isort` for import sorting. It also uses `ruff`  To ensure code quality, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Format the code
black .
isort .
```

### Testing

BANG uses `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Linting

BANG uses `ruff` for linting. To run the linter, you can use the following command:

```bash
ruff check .
```

### Release process

In order to release a new version of BANG, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`.

2. Commit the changes with a message like "Bump version to X.Y.Z".

3. Tag the commit with the new version number: `git tag vX.Y.Z`. Beware that the tag must be in the format `vX.Y.Z[-prerelease]` (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

4. Push the changes and the tag to the remote repository: `git push origin main --tags`.

- If the tag indicates a pre-release version and is not on the main branch, CD will deploy the package to TestPyPI.

- If the commit is on main and the tag does not contain a prerelease version, it will be deployed to PyPI.
