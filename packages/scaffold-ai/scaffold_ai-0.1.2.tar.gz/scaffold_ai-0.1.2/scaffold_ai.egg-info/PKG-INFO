# Scaffold-AI

Scaffold-AI is a powerful CLI tool that leverages AI to generate new project scaffolds quickly and efficiently. Powered by the OpenAI API, it allows you to create projects with customizable templates, supporting both Vite and vanilla setups.

## Features

- **AI-powered scaffolding**: Generate project structures using advanced AI models.
- **Flexible model selection**: Choose your preferred OpenAI model for generation.
- **Multiple templates**: Scaffold projects with Vite or vanilla code.
- **Standalone operation**: Functions independently through the command line without requiring specific editors or plugins.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vjtvalero/scaffold-ai.git
cd scaffold-ai
```

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management. You can use either `uv` or Python's built-in `venv`:

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or if you used uv:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Set your OpenAI API key and run the CLI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key> && py main.py
```

Follow the prompts to scaffold your new project.
