class SignalBasedModel(CommunicationModels):
    """
     A physics-based model for wireless signal propagation between agents.

    This model simulates realistic wireless communication by:
    1. Calculating signal strength based on physical distance using inverse-square law
    2. Applying signal strength thresholds for minimal connectivity
    3. Modeling probabilistic packet loss that increases with distance
    4. Using spatial indexing for computational efficiency

    The model is based on fundamental principles of electromagnetic wave propagation,
    making it suitable for research on wireless networks, robot swarms, sensor networks,
    and other systems with physical communication constraints.
