"""
Prediction module for ARC-Eval reliability prediction.

This module implements the hybrid approach combining:
- Deterministic compliance rules for regulatory requirements
- LLM-powered pattern recognition for complex reliability assessment

Components:
- ComplianceRuleEngine: Deterministic rules for PII, security, audit compliance
- LLMReliabilityPredictor: GPT-4.1 powered pattern recognition
- HybridReliabilityPredictor: Weighted combination of both approaches
