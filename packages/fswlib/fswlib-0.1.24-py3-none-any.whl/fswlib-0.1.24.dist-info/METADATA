# Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding — a PyTorch-based library

This package provides an implementation of the **Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding** for multisets and measures, introduced in our [ICLR 2025 paper](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/30562):

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python** ≥ 3.10.3 (released March 2022)  
- **PyTorch** ≥ 2.1.0 (released October 2023)  
- **NumPy** ≥ 1.24.4 (released June 2023)  
  
The core package has been tested on **Linux** and **Windows**.  
It may also run on **macOS (CPU only)**, though this has not been verified.  


---

## 🔧 Installation

To install the package:

```bash
pip install fswlib
```

The core package runs on both **CPU** and **CUDA-enabled GPUs**, using PyTorch's standard CUDA backend.  

In addition, it includes an optional **custom CUDA extension** that can provide up to 2× speedup for sparse weight matrices (e.g., sparse graphs). This extension is currently supported only on **Linux**.

  
To compile the optional extension, run:

```bash
fswlib-build
```


---

## 📘 Usage Example

Below is a basic usage example of the `FSWEmbedding` class.  

For more examples, see the [`examples/`](https://github.com/tal-amir/fswlib/tree/main/examples) directory.  
Full API documentation is available at [https://tal-amir.github.io/fswlib](https://tal-amir.github.io/fswlib).


```python
import torch

from fswlib import FSWEmbedding

dtype=torch.float32
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

d = 15  # dimension of input multiset elements
n = 50  # multiset size
m = 123 # embedding output dimension

# If False, input multisets are treated as uniform distributions over their elements,
# making the embedding invariant to the multiset size.
encode_total_mass = True

# Generate an embedding module
embed = FSWEmbedding(d_in=d, d_out=m, encode_total_mass=encode_total_mass, device=device, dtype=dtype)

# Generate and embed one multiset
X = torch.randn(size=(n,d), dtype=dtype, device=device)
X_emb = embed(X)

# Generate and embed a batch of multisets
# Supports input with any number of batch dimensions
batch_dims = (5,3,4)
Xb = torch.randn(size=batch_dims+(n,d), dtype=dtype, device=device)
Xb_emb = embed(Xb)

print(f"Dimension of multiset elements: {d}\nEmbedding dimension: {m}")
print(f'\nOne input multiset X of size {n}:')
print('Shape of X: ', X.shape)
print('Shape of embed(X): ', X_emb.shape)
batch_dim_str = "×".join(str(d) for d in batch_dims)
print(f'\nA batch Xb of {batch_dim_str} input multisets, each of size {n}: ')
print('Shape of Xb: ', Xb.shape)
print('Shape of embed(Xb): ', Xb_emb.shape)
```

Output:
```
Dimension of multiset elements: 15
Embedding dimension: 123

One input multiset X of size 50:
Shape of X:  torch.Size([50, 15])
Shape of embed(X):  torch.Size([123])

A batch Xb of 5×3×4 input multisets, each of size 50:
Shape of Xb:  torch.Size([5, 3, 4, 50, 15])
Shape of embed(Xb):  torch.Size([5, 3, 4, 123])
```
