# CEPiK Vehicle History Client

A Python client for retrieving vehicle history data from the Polish government's historiapojazdu.gov.pl service (CEPIK - Centralna Ewidencja Pojazdów i Kierowców).

## Description

This repository contains a Python library that provides programmatic access to vehicle history information from the CEPiK database. The client handles session management, authentication, and data retrieval for both technical vehicle data and timeline/history information.

## Features

- **Session Management**: Automatic creation and management of authenticated sessions with moj.gov.pl
- **Vehicle Technical Data**: Retrieve detailed technical specifications and current vehicle information
- **Timeline Data**: Access complete vehicle history including ownership changes, registrations, and other events
- **Context Manager**: Convenient `authenticated_session()` context manager for automatic session cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- **Session Cleanup**: Proper session closure to prevent conflicts between executions

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- PyPI

## Installation

You can install the client using pip:

```bash
pip install cepik-vehicle-history-client
```

## Usage

To use the client, you need three pieces of information about the vehicle:
- Registration number (license plate)
- VIN number
- First registration date

### Basic Example with Context Manager (Recommended)

```python
from cepik_vehicle_history_client import VehicleHistoryClient, VehicleInfo

# Create vehicle info object
vehicle_info = VehicleInfo(
    registration_number="ABC12345",
    vin="1234567890ABCDEFG",
    first_registration_date="2020-01-15"
)

# Use context manager for automatic session management
client = VehicleHistoryClient()

try:
    with client.authenticated_session() as session:
        # Get vehicle technical data
        vehicle_data = session.get_vehicle_data(vehicle_info)
        print("Vehicle Data:", vehicle_data)
        
        # Get vehicle timeline/history
        timeline_data = session.get_timeline_data(vehicle_info)
        print("Timeline Data:", timeline_data)
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Manual Session Management

```python
from cepik_vehicle_history_client import VehicleHistoryClient, VehicleInfo

# Create client and vehicle info
client = VehicleHistoryClient()
vehicle_info = VehicleInfo(
    registration_number="ABC12345",
    vin="1234567890ABCDEFG",
    first_registration_date="2020-01-15"
)

try:
    # Manual session creation and authentication
    client.create_session()
    client.authenticate_session()
    
    # Get vehicle data
    vehicle_data = client.get_vehicle_data(vehicle_info)
    print("Vehicle Data:", vehicle_data)
    
    # Get timeline data
    timeline_data = client.get_timeline_data(vehicle_info)
    print("Timeline Data:", timeline_data)
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    # Always close the session
    client.close_session()
```

## API Reference

### Classes

#### `VehicleInfo`
A dataclass containing vehicle identification information.

**Attributes:**
- `registration_number` (str): Vehicle registration number (license plate)
- `vin` (str): Vehicle Identification Number
- `first_registration_date` (str): First registration date in YYYY-MM-DD format

#### `VehicleHistoryClient`
Main client class for accessing the CEPiK vehicle history service.

### Methods

#### `create_session() -> dict[str, str]`
Creates a new session with the moj.gov.pl service and retrieves necessary cookies.

#### `authenticate_session() -> tuple[dict[str, str], str]`
Authenticates the session and returns updated cookies along with the session ID (NF_WID).

#### `get_vehicle_data(vehicle_info: VehicleInfo) -> dict`
Retrieves technical vehicle data including specifications, current status, and registration details.

#### `get_timeline_data(vehicle_info: VehicleInfo) -> dict`
Retrieves historical timeline data showing the vehicle's registration history, ownership changes, and other events.

#### `close_session() -> None`
Properly closes the session to free up resources on the server.

#### `authenticated_session()` (Context Manager)
Context manager that automatically handles session creation, authentication, and cleanup.

### Exceptions

#### `VehicleHistoryClientError`
Base exception class for all client-related errors.

## Data Format

The service returns data in Polish. Common fields include:
- **Vehicle Data**: Technical specifications, current registration status, vehicle category
- **Timeline Data**: Chronological history of registrations, ownership transfers, inspections

## Important Notes

- This client accesses a Polish government service - use it responsibly and in accordance with their terms of service and local law
- The service may have rate limiting - avoid making excessive requests
- **Always** ensure sessions are properly closed (use the context manager when possible)
- Vehicle data requires accurate input - incorrect VIN, registration number, or date will result in no data

## Legal and Ethical Use

This tool is intended for legitimate purposes, e.g.:
- Vehicle purchase verification
- Fleet management
- Insurance verification

Please ensure you have proper authorization to access vehicle information and comply with Polish data protection laws.
