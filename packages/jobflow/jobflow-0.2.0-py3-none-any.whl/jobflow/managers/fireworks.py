    Parameters
    ----------
    flow
        A flow or job.
    store
        A job store. Alternatively, if set to None, :obj:`JobflowSettings.JOB_STORE`

    allow_external_references
        If False all the references to other outputs should be from other Jobs

    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to Workflow init method.

    -------
    Workflow
        The job or flow as a workflow.
