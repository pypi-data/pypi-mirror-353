Jobflow is a free, open-source library for writing and executing workflows. Complex
workflows can be defined using simple python functions and executed locally or on
arbitrary computing resources using the [jobflow-remote][jfr] or [FireWorks][fireworks]
workflow managers.

Some features that distinguish jobflow are dynamic workflows, easy compositing and
connecting of workflows, and the ability to store workflow outputs across multiple
databases.

## Is jobflow for me

jobflow is intended to be a friendly workflow software that is easy to get started with,
but flexible enough to handle complicated use cases.

Some of its features include:

- A clean and flexible Python API.
- A powerful approach to compositing and connecting workflows — information passing
  between jobs is a key goal of jobflow. Workflows can be nested allowing for a natural
  way to build complex workflows.
- Integration with multiple databases (MongoDB, S3, GridFS, and more) through the
  [Maggma][maggma] package.
- Support for the [jobflow-remote][jfr] and [FireWorks][fireworks] workflow management systems, allowing workflow
  execution on multicore machines or through a queue, on a single machine or multiple
  machines.
- Support for dynamic workflows — workflows that modify themselves or create new ones
  based on what happens during execution.

## Workflow model

Workflows in jobflows are made up of two main components:

- A `Job` is an atomic computing job. Essentially any python function can be `Job`,
  provided its input and return values can be serialized to json. Anything returned by the job is
  considered an "output" and is stored in the jobflow database.
- A `Flow` is a collection of `Job` objects or other `Flow` objects. The connectivity
  between jobs is determined automatically from the job inputs. The execution order
  of jobs is automatically determined based on their connectivity.

Python functions can be easily converted in to `Job` objects using the `@job` decorator.
In the example below, we define a job to add two numbers.

```python
from jobflow import job, Flow

@job
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add_first = add(1, 5)
add_second = add(add_first.output, 5)

flow = Flow([add_first, add_second])
flow.draw_graph().show()
```

The output of the job is accessed using the `output` attribute. As the job has not
yet been run, `output` contains be a reference to a future output. Outputs can be used
as inputs to other jobs and will be automatically "resolved" before the job is
executed.

Finally, we created a flow using the two `Job` objects. The connectivity between
the jobs is determined automatically and can be visualised using the flow graph.

## Installation

`jobflow` is a Python 3.9+ library and can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install jobflow
```
