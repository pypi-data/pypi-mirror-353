Overview of Discussion Topics
=============================

**Development Journey**: From Empty Module to Production Tool
   Complete chronicle of FailExtract's 4-day transformation from empty module to production-ready library. Learn the decisions, discoveries, and insights that shaped the architecture through real development experience.

**Architectural Philosophy**: Building for Real-World Use
   Explores the fundamental principles that shaped FailExtract's architecture, from respecting user constraints to explicit complexity management. Learn how real-world deployment considerations drove design decisions.

**Progressive Enhancement**: From Simple to Sophisticated
   Deep dive into FailExtract's layered architecture that allows users to start simple and grow sophisticated without breaking changes. Understand the engineering disciplines required for successful progressive enhancement.

**Performance Trade-offs**: When More Information Costs More Time  
   Analysis of the exponential relationship between feature richness and performance overhead. Learn how FailExtract's multi-mode approach addresses different performance requirements across production, development, and debugging contexts.

**Documentation Philosophy**: From Aspirational to Honest
   The transformation from documenting desired features to documenting actual capabilities. Explore how documentation philosophy affects user trust, support burden, and long-term maintainability.

**Testing Strategy**: Architecture, Organization, and Quality Assurance
   Comprehensive exploration of FailExtract's multi-dimensional testing approach. Learn how test organization drives architecture quality and how different testing strategies (unit, integration, property, performance) each provide unique value.

**Feature Scope Management**: Strategic Simplicity Over Feature Completeness
   The decision-making process behind removing 30-40% of planned features to create a focused, maintainable tool. Understand the strategic value of deliberate feature scope management and the real costs of feature complexity.

These discussions are based on real development experience and contain concrete examples, data, and lessons learned from building FailExtract. They're designed to help both users understand FailExtract's design rationale and developers apply similar principles in their own projects.
