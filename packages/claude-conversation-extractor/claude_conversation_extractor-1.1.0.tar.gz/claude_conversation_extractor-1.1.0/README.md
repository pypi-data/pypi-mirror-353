## 🎯 Problem Solved

Claude Code stores all your conversations locally but doesn't provide an
easy way to export them. This tool:

- 📤 Extracts conversations from Claude's undocumented JSONL format
- 📝 Converts them to clean, readable markdown
- 🔍 Makes your Claude history searchable and archivable
- 💾 Preserves your work when sessions crash or get cleared
- 🚀 Works with your existing Claude Code installation

## ✨ Features

- **Clean Markdown Export**: Get your conversations in readable markdown
  format
- **Batch Operations**: Extract single, multiple, or all conversations at
  once
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically finds the best location for your logs
- **Zero Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Session Management**: List, search, and organize your Claude sessions
- **Preserves Context**: Maintains timestamps and session IDs

## 📦 Installation

### Install with pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install claude-conversation-extractor
```

That's it! The `claude-extract` command will be available system-wide.

### Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZeroSumQuant/claude-conversation-extractor.git
cd claude-conversation-extractor

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install claude-conversation-extractor

# Launch the interactive UI
claude-extract --export logs
```

That's it! The big magenta UI will guide you through extracting your conversations.

## 🎯 Usage

### Interactive Mode (Easiest!)

```bash
# Main command
claude-extract --export logs

# Quick shortcut
claude-start

# Alternative flags
claude-extract --interactive
claude-extract -i
```

The interactive mode provides:
- 📁 Easy folder selection with suggestions
- 📋 Visual list of all your conversations
- 🎯 Simple selection options (All, Recent, or Specific)
- 📊 Progress bars during extraction
- 🗂️ Auto-opens the output folder when done

### Basic Commands

```bash
# List all available Claude sessions
claude-extract --list

# Extract the most recent conversation
claude-extract --extract 1

# Extract multiple specific conversations
claude-extract --extract 1,3,5

# Extract the 5 most recent conversations
claude-extract --recent 5

# Extract all conversations
claude-extract --all

# Specify custom output directory
claude-extract --extract 1 --output ~/my-claude-logs
```

### Shell Aliases (Recommended)

Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Quick access commands
alias claude-list='claude-extract --list'
alias claude-recent='claude-extract --recent 5'
alias claudelogs='open ~/Desktop/Claude\ logs'  # macOS
# alias claudelogs='xdg-open ~/Desktop/Claude\ logs'  # Linux
```

## 📁 Output Format

Conversations are saved as markdown files with this structure:

```text
claude-conversation-2025-05-25-a1b2c3d4.md
├── Session metadata (ID, date, time)
├── User messages (👤)
├── Claude responses (🤖)
└── Clean formatting with no terminal artifacts
```

### Example Output

```markdown
# Claude Conversation Log

Session ID: a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
Date: 2025-05-25 14:30:00

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. Claude Code stores conversations in `~/.claude/projects/` as JSONL
   files
2. This tool parses the undocumented JSONL format
3. Extracts user prompts and Claude responses
4. Converts to clean markdown without terminal formatting
5. Preserves conversation flow and context

### File Locations

- **Source**: `~/.claude/projects/*/chat_*.jsonl`
- **Default Output**: `~/Desktop/Claude logs/` (or
  `~/Documents/Claude logs/`)
- **Fallback**: Current directory if default locations aren't writable

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Claude Code installed and used at least once
- No external dependencies required
