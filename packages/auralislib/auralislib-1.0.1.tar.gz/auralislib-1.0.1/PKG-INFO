## üöÄ What is auralislib?

**auralislib** is a Python library designed to make working with voice, audio, and image data creative and intelligent. It enables:
- Voice cloning & synthesis  
- Text-to-speech (TTS)  
- Speech-to-text (STT)  
- Image fetching & transformation  
- Multimodal features (text ‚Üí image ‚Üí audio) (upcoming features)
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Generate synthetic speech from text and text from speech
- ‚úÖ Clone voices from audio samples (upcoming features)
- ‚úÖ Fetch and process images using the Unsplash API (upcoming features)
- ‚úÖ Basic image editing (resize, crop, filters) (upcoming features)
- ‚úÖ Plan for future AI-powered voice & image fusion (upcoming features)
---

## üì¶ Installation

<pre lang="markdown"> pip install auralislib </pre>
---

## Usage
1. Text-to-speech
<pre lang="markdown"> 
  from auralislib.TTS.synth import synthesize
  synthesize("Hello world!", "output.wav")
</pre>

2. Speech-to-text
<pre lang="markdown"> 
  from auralislib.STT.inference import transcribe
  text = transcribe("samples/audio.wav")
  print(text)
</pre>
