        '''
        Generates adjacent connectivity between dams based on the input stream network.
        Each dam is represented by a unique stream segment identifier.

        Returns a dictionary with two keys: 'downstream' and 'upstream'.

        - The value of 'downstream' is a dictionary where each key is a dam's stream identifier from
          the input `dam_list`, and the value is the adjacent downstream connected dam's stream identifier.
          A value of -1 indicates that the dam has no downstream connectivity.

        ..

        - The value of 'upstream' is a dictionary where each key is a dam's stream identifier from the
          `dam_list`, and the value is a list of adjacent upstream connected dam stream identifiers.
          An empty list indicates that the dam has no upstream connectivity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stream_file : str
            Path to the input stream shapefile.

        stream_col : str
            Column name in the stream shapefile containing
            a unique identifier for each stream segment.

        dam_list : list
            List of stream segment identifiers representing dam locations.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary with two keys, 'downstream' and 'upstream'. Each maps to a dictionary representing
            the adjacent downstream and upstream connectivity of dams, respectively, based on the stream network.
