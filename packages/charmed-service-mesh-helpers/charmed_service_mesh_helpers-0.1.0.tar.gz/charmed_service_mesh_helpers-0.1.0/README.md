# charmed-service-mesh-helpers
A collection of helpers and shared code from the Service Mesh team.

The goal of this is a place to put **lightweight** shared code that's used in multiple Service Mesh charms.  Anything kept here should require very lightweight dependencies, typically the standard library or very common dependencies.
