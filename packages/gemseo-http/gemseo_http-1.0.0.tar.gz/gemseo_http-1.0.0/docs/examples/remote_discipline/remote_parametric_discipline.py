Remote discipline execution
===========================

This example demonstrates how to execute a remote discipline using the
`HTTPDiscipline` class from the `gemseo_http` package.

# Instantiate the `HTTPDiscipline` class for the remote discipline.
# Use options to pass to the remote discipline constructor

# In this specific case, the jacobian has been computed during the execution,
# and is cached.
