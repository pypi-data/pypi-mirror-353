Sellar problem with Sellar2 discipline remote
=============================================

This script defines and solves the Sellar problem, with Sellar2 discipline remote.

The Sellar problem is a well-known benchmark test for optimization algorithms
applied to MDO problems. It consists of three disciplines that are coupled:
1. Sellar1
2. Sellar2
3. SellarSystem

In this example, we demonstrate how one of the disciplines (`Sellar2`) can be managed
remotely using the `HTTPDiscipline` class from the `gemseo_http` package. This enables
remote computation by sending discipline-specific input data to an HTTP-based service,
executing the discipline remotely, and retrieving the results back to the local system.

# %%
# Step 1: Create the Sellar disciplines (`Sellar1` and `SellarSystem`) locally.
# These are executed directly in the local environment.
configure_logger()
httpx_logger = logging.getLogger("httpx")
httpx_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

sellar1, sellar_system = create_discipline(["Sellar1", "SellarSystem"])

# %%
# Step 2: Configure the `Sellar2` discipline to be executed remotely.
# The `HTTPDiscipline` acts as a proxy for the remote discipline, handling:
# - Authentication with the remote service through a username and password.
# - Sending input data to the HTTP service endpoint.
# - Receiving output data from the HTTP service.
#
# NOTE: The current configuration uses a mock HTTP service (`url` and `port`).
#       In a real-world scenario, ensure these are correctly set for the actual remote server.
# Key Explanation of HTTPDiscipline:
sellar2 = HTTPDiscipline(
    name="RemoteSellar2",
    class_name="Sellar2",
    url="http://localhost",
    port=8000,
    user="test",
    password="test",
)

# %%
# Step 3: Make a list of all the disciplines into a single list for the MDO process.
# As the sellar2 object is a plain discipline, it can be mixed with the other disciplines.
disciplines = [sellar1, sellar2, sellar_system]

# %%
# Step 4: Define the optimization problem.
