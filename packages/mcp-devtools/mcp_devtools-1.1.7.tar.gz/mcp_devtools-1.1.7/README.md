- üîß `mcp-devtools` offers a comprehensive suite of development tools:
- üìÑ For detailed overview of all tools, their arguments, and descriptions, please refer to the [Server Module Documentation](docs/server_documentation.md) or [Available Tools section](#available-tools).
  -  üéã Git management operations (`git_status`, `git_stage_and_commit`, `git_diff`, `git_diff_all`, `git_log`, `git_create_branch`, `git_reset` `git_checkout`, `git_show`)
  -  üìÅ Git file operations (`git_read_file`, `git_apply_diff`)
  -  üìÇ Direct file operations (`search_and_replace`, `write_to_file`)
  -  üñ•Ô∏è Terminal commands execution (`execute_command`)
  -  ü§ñ AI-assisted file operations using [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) (`ai_edit` (`aider_status` for systems ready check ))
    <br> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When using the `ai_edit` tool, please refer to the [Aider Configuration documentation](docs/aider_config.md) for detailed instructions.
- üåê All these functions are accessible via Server-Sent Events (SSE), making it a powerful and versatile server for various development needs.
- üõ°Ô∏è Filesystem access boundaries are maintained via passing `repo_path` to every file command, so AI assistant only has read/write access to files in the current workspace (or whatever it decides to pass as `repo_path` , make sure system prompt is solid on that part).
  <br> ‚ö†Ô∏è Execise extreme caution with auto-allowing `execute_command` tool or at least don't leave AI assistant unattended when doing so. MCP server won't stop assistant from `execute_command` rm -rf ~/*

## Use Cases

- üåê Use it to extend online chat-based assistants such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini or AI Studio, Perplexity, Grok, OpenRouter Chat, DeepSeek, Kagi, T3 Chat with direct access to local files, git, terminal commands execution and AI-assisted file editing capabilities via [MCP-SuperAssistant](https://github.com/srbhptl39/MCP-SuperAssistant/) or similar projects.
- ü¶ò Use it to boost code editors like Cursor, Windsurf or VSCode extensions like Roo Code, Cline, Copilot or Augment with intuitive Git management and AI-assisted file editing capabilities and say goodbye to those pesky diff application failures wasting your tool calls or `Roo having trouble...` breaking your carefully engineered automation workflows. Aider seems to get diffs right!
  - For [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code), place [.roomodes](https://github.com/daoch4n/zen-ai-mcp-devtools/blob/main/.roomodes) into your repo root and Roo will pick it up as `ü§ñ AI Code` mode that `ü™É Orchestrator` mode can call.


## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install uv
```

## Running from pypi

```bash
uvx mcp-devtools@latest -p 1337
```
## Running from git

### Linux/macOS

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/daoch4n/zen-ai-mcp-devtools/"
cd zen-ai-mcp-devtools
./server.sh -p 1337
```

### Windows

```powershell
git clone "https://github.com/daoch4n/zen-ai-mcp-devtools/"
cd zen-ai-mcp-devtools
.\server.ps1 -p 1337
```

## AI System Prompt

```
You have development tools at your disposal. Use relevant tools from devtools MCP server for git management, file operations, and terminal access. When using any tool from devtools, always provide the current repository full current working directory path as the 'repo_path' option, do not set it to any other folder. 'repo_path' must be explicitly asked from user in beginning of conversation. When using execute_command tool, the current working directory will be set to repo_path provided. When using it for file manipulations, make sure to pass full path in the terminal command including repo_path prefix as manipulated file path.
```

## MCP Server Configuration

To integrate `mcp-devtools` with your AI assistant, add the following configuration to your MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devtools": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:1337/sse",
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": [],
      "timeout": 999
    }
  }
}
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

**Issue:**
### `write_to_file` and üíæ Direct Code Editing vs ü§ñ Delegated Editing by Coding Agent

*    üîç When using the `write_to_file` tool for direct code editing, especially with languages like JavaScript that utilize template literals (strings enclosed by backticks), you may encounter unexpected syntax errors. This issue stems from how the AI assistant generates the `content` string, where backticks and dollar signs within template literals might be incorrectly escaped with extra backslashes (`\`).

**Mitigation:** 

*    üî® The `write_to_file` tool integrates with `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.ts` files. The output of `tsc --noEmit --allowJs` is provided as part of the tool's response. AI assistants should parse this output to detect any compiler errors and *should not proceed with further actions* if errors are reported, indicating a problem with the written code.

**Workarounds:**

*    ü§ñ (most reliable) Instruct your AI assistant to delegate editing files to MCP-compatible coding agent by adding it as another MCP server, as it is more suitable for direct code manipulation, and let AI assistant act as task orchestrator that will write down plans and docs with `write_to_file` and delegate coding to specialized agent, then use `git_read_file` or `git_diff` to check up on agent's work, and manage commits and branches `Aider` via [its MCP bridge](https://github.com/sengokudaikon/aider-mcp-server) is already integrated as `ai_edit` tool).
*    üñ•Ô∏è (if you're feeling lucky) Instruct your AI assistant to craft a terminal command to edit problematic file via `execute_command` tool.

### `ai_edit`
- **Description:** AI pair programming tool for making targeted code changes using Aider. Use this tool to:
  1. Implement new features or functionality in existing code
  2. Add tests to an existing codebase
  3. Fix bugs in code
  4. Refactor or improve existing code
  5. Make structural changes across multiple files

  The tool requires:
  - A repository path where the code exists
  - A detailed message describing what changes to make. Please only describe one change per message. If you need to make multiple changes, please submit multiple requests.

  **Edit Format Selection:**
  If the `edit_format` option is not explicitly provided, the default is selected based on the model name:
  - If the model includes `gemini`, defaults to `diff-fenced`
  - If the model includes `gpt`, defaults to `udiff`
  - Otherwise, defaults to `diff`

  Best practices for messages:
  - Be specific about what files or components to modify
  - Describe the desired behavior or functionality clearly
  - Provide context about the existing codebase structure
  - Include any constraints or requirements to follow

  Examples of good messages:
  - "Add unit tests for the Customer class in src/models/customer.rb testing the validation logic"
  - "Implement pagination for the user listing API in the controllers/users_controller.js file"
  - "Fix the bug in utils/date_formatter.py where dates before 1970 aren't handled correctly"
