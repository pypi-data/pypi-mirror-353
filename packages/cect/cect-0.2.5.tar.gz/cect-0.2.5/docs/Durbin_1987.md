**Summary**

- Established a computer database of the synaptic connectivity data obtained by White and colleagues.

- For each pair of neurons, it stores the number of gap junctions between them and the number of chemical synapses in each direction.

- For the NSH series, there is a measure of adjacency or degree of mutual contact between each pair of processes.
