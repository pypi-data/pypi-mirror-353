**Summary**

- The _C. elegans_ nerve ring neuropil is organized into four distinct layers (strata), each corresponding to specific behavioural circuits. These strata reflect a topographic and functional segregation of sensory inputs and motor outputs along the anterior–posterior axis of the worm.

- The authors developed and applied a novel “diffusion condensation” clustering algorithm with 3D visualization (C-PHATE) to analyze over 100,000 neuron-neuron contact instances. This revealed nested structural and circuit relationships that differ from traditional synaptic connectivity maps.

- A subset of highly connected interneurons, termed “rich-club” neurons, bridge across multiple strata and function as key integrators of neural circuits, supporting communication between segregated layers and facilitating complex behaviors.

- Using in vivo 4D imaging and cell tracking, the study showed that neuropil assembly is guided by early outgrowth from a small group of centrally located “pioneer” neurons in stratum S2. This initiates an inside-out developmental sequence essential for forming the layered architecture.
