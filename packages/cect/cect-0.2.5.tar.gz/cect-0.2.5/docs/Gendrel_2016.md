**Abstract**

- Reports a comprehensive neurotransmitter map of neurons in the _C.elegans_ connectome revealing twice as many GABA-positive neuron classes as previously reported.
- This data was later used and incorporated into [Bentley et al. 2016](Bentley_2016.md) multilayer connectome and [Randi et al. 2023](Randi_2023.md) functional connectome.
