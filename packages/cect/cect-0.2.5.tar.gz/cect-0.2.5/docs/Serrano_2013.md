**Summary**

- The key defining feature of glutamatergic neurons is EAT-4/VGLUT which is present in 38 out of 118 neuron classes.<br>
- Data is included in WormAtlas which has been compiled into a single [dataset](https://github.com/openworm/ConnectomeToolbox/blob/main/cect/data/Modified%20celegans%20db%20dump.csv)
- This data was later used to construct the functional connectome of [Randi et al. 2023](Randi_2023.md) and the multi-layer connectome of [Bentley et al. 2016](Bentley_2016.md).
