**Summary**

- An updated connectome using [Elegance software](Resources.md#elegance) for annotation of synapses.
- An extension of the previous reported pharyngeal connectome ([Albertson & Thomson 1976](Albertson_1976.md)) by describing the connectivity with anatomical weights.
- They verified 94% (50/53) of the chemical synaptic connections between cell classes previously reported in the pharynx ([Albertson & Thomson 1976](Albertson_1976.md)).
