**Summary**


- Two complete volumetric reconstructions of the _C.elegans_ nerve ring from previously published EMs [White et al. 1986](White_1986.md)
    - adult
    - larval stage 4 (L4) worm
- Two series of EMs span approx the same volume with a length of 36 micrometres, starting in the anterior and ending in the ventral ganglia.
- The reconstructions of these two nerve rings provide the first complete, nanoscale-resolution datasets of all neuronal membrane contacts of any neuropil.
- Presents a **"contactome"**: the set of membrane contacts of the brain.
- They define two neurons as immediate neighbours if the membranes along their neural processes are physically adjacent in at least one EM.
- To characterise synaptic pathways within a spatial context, they integrated volumetric reconstructions with recent re-scoring of synapses on the same L4 and adult worms ([Cook et al. 2019](Cook_2019.md)) for validation and comparison with other datasets: [White et al. 1986](White_1986.md); [Witvliet et al. 2021](Witvliet_2021.md))
