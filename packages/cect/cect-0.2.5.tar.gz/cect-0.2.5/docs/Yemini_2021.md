**Summary**

- Identified brainwide expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for ACh, GABA, and Glu completing a map of this communication network.
- Uncovered changes in cell fate caused by TF mutations.
- Recorded brainwide activity in response to attractive and repulsive chemosensory cues, characterizing multimodal coding for these stimuli.
- This data was used by [Ripoll-Sanchez et al. 2023](RipollSanchez_2023.md) to generate the neuropeptidergic connectome.
