**Summary**
 
- Used EM series to reconstruct the posterior nervous system of the adult hermaphrodite _C.elegans_.
- 40 neurons in the tail of the adult were identified and a complete list of synapses was assembled for 2 isogenic animals.
- This list was compared with ta third isogenic animal reconstructed by [White et al. 1986](White_1986.md).
- [Varshney et al. 2011](Varshney_2011.md) later incorporated this published synaptic connectivity data to build their connectome.
