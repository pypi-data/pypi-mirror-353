**Summary**

- The anatomical connectome of the pharynx was reconstructed from serial electron micrographs.
- The connectivity of this region was described at the level of individual synaptic regions differentiating electrical gap junction connections and chemical synaptic connections.
- Composed of 34 muscle cells, 9 marginal cells, 9 epithelial cells, 5 gland cells and 20 neurons.
