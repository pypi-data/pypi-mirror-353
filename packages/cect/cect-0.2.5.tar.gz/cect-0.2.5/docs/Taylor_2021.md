**Summary**

- Gene expression profiles of all 118 neuron classes in the _C.elegans_ hermaphrodite
- Each neuron type expresses a distinct code of neuropeptide genes and receptors
- Expression profiles enable discovery of cell-type-specific _cis_-regulatory sequences
- Cell adhesion molecules correlate with neuron-specific connectivity.
- This data was used by [Ripoll-Sanchez et al. 2023](RipollSanchez_2023.md) to generate the neuropeptidergic connectome.
