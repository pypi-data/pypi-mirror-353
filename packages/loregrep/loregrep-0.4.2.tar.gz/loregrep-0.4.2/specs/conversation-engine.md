# Conversation Engine Technical Specification

## Overview

A conversation engine is a sophisticated orchestration system that manages multi-turn dialogues between users and AI agents while handling tool calls, maintaining context, and providing rich response formatting. This specification defines the architecture and implementation patterns for building robust, reusable conversation engines.

## Architecture Principles

### Core Design Philosophy

The conversation engine follows a **loop-based architecture** where each user input triggers a cycle that may involve multiple AI agent responses and tool executions before producing a final response. This design enables:

- **Autonomous Tool Usage**: Agents can chain multiple tool calls to gather information
- **Context Preservation**: Conversation history is maintained across interactions
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Failures in any part of the loop are contained and reported
- **Extensibility**: New tools and response formatters can be easily integrated

### Key Components

1. **Conversation Context Manager**: Handles message history with configurable retention
2. **Tool Execution Engine**: Manages tool calls, responses, and multi-turn scenarios
3. **Response Builder**: Constructs and formats final responses for users
4. **Command Processor**: Handles special user commands and system operations
5. **Message Formatter**: Provides rich formatting for different message types

## Part 1: Conversation History Management

### Storage Strategy

The conversation history should be managed as a **circular buffer** with configurable limits to balance context preservation with memory efficiency.

#### History Structure

Each conversation maintains:
- **Message Queue**: Chronologically ordered messages with role identification
- **Context Window**: Configurable maximum number of messages to retain
- **Metadata Tracking**: Timestamps, token counts, and interaction identifiers
- **Session Management**: Support for multiple concurrent conversations

#### Configuration Parameters

- `max_history_messages`: Maximum number of messages to retain (default: 20)
- `max_history_tokens`: Token-based limit for context window management
- `history_retention_policy`: Strategy for removing old messages (FIFO, priority-based)
- `context_compression`: Enable/disable summarization of older context

#### Implementation Considerations

**Memory Management**: Implement automatic cleanup when history limits are exceeded. Consider using weak references for large message content to allow garbage collection.

**Persistence Options**: Support both in-memory and persistent storage backends. For persistent storage, consider:
- File-based storage for single-user scenarios
- Database storage for multi-user applications
- Encrypted storage for sensitive conversations

**Context Relevance**: Implement intelligent context pruning that preserves important messages (tool calls, errors, key decisions) while removing routine exchanges.

## Part 2: Tool Call Handling

### Tool Execution Lifecycle

Tool calls represent one of the most complex aspects of conversation engines, requiring careful orchestration of multiple asynchronous operations.

#### Parsing Tool Responses

**Response Structure Detection**: Implement robust parsing to identify:
- Tool call identifiers and names
- Input parameters and validation
- Mixed content responses (text + tool calls)
- Malformed or incomplete tool specifications

**Parameter Validation**: Before executing tools:
- Validate required parameters are present
- Type-check parameter values against tool schemas
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Apply rate limiting and resource constraints

#### Multi-Turn Tool Execution

**Iteration Management**: Support chains of tool calls where:
- Results from one tool inform the next tool call
- Agent can analyze partial results and decide on next steps
- Context from previous tool calls is preserved
- Intermediate results are accumulated for final response

**Loop Control Mechanisms**:
- `max_tool_iterations`: Prevent infinite loops (recommended: 5-10)
- `tool_timeout`: Individual tool execution timeouts
- `total_conversation_timeout`: Overall conversation time limits
- `tool_call_depth`: Maximum nesting level for tool chains

#### Tool Result Processing

**Success Handling**: When tools execute successfully:
- Capture structured output data
- Preserve execution metadata (timing, resource usage)
- Format results for agent consumption
- Log tool usage for debugging and analytics

**Error Recovery**: When tools fail:
- Capture detailed error information
- Provide fallback mechanisms where possible
- Allow agent to request alternative approaches
- Maintain conversation flow despite failures

### Tool Integration Patterns

**Schema-Based Integration**: Tools should be defined with:
- JSON Schema for input validation
- Clear documentation of expected outputs
- Error condition specifications
- Resource requirement declarations

**Dependency Management**: For tools that depend on external services:
- Implement circuit breakers for service failures
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Provide offline/degraded mode operations
- Handle API rate limits gracefully

## Part 3: Custom Command Processing

### Command Classification

Custom commands provide users with direct control over the conversation engine and access to special functions.

#### System Commands

**Conversation Management**:
- `/clear`: Reset conversation history
- `/history`: Display conversation summary
- `/export`: Save conversation to file
- `/import`: Load previous conversation

**Engine Control**:
- `/debug`: Toggle debug mode and verbose logging
- `/model`: Switch AI models or configuration
- `/tools`: List available tools and their status
- `/config`: View or modify engine configuration

#### User-Defined Commands

**Extensibility Framework**: Allow applications to register custom commands:
- Command registration API with validation
- Parameter parsing and help text generation
- Permission and access control integration
- Async command execution support

**Command Processing Pipeline**:
1. **Recognition**: Identify commands using configurable prefixes (/, !, #)
2. **Parsing**: Extract command name and parameters
3. **Validation**: Check permissions and parameter validity
4. **Execution**: Run command logic with proper error handling
5. **Response**: Format command output for user display

### Command Implementation Patterns

**Command Registration**: Implement a plugin-style system where commands can be:
- Dynamically loaded at runtime
- Organized by functional categories
- Enabled/disabled based on user permissions
- Extended with custom help and documentation

**Context Awareness**: Commands should have access to:
- Current conversation state
- Tool execution results
- User preferences and settings
- Application-specific context data

## Part 4: Response Building
