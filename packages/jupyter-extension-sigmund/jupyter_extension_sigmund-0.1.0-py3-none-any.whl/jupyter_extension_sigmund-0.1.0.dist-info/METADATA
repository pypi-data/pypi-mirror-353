# Jupyter extension for SigmundAI

__Disclaimer: This is an early development preview__

This is an extension for Jupyterlab, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Rapunzel, or any other application that uses a Jupyter/ IPython based console. It allows you to connect your Python session to [SigmundAI](https://sigmundai.eu). This is mainly intended as a tool for coding and data analysis.

__IMPORTANT__: By connecting your Python session to Sigmund, you give an artificial intelligence (AI) full access to your file system. You are fully responsible for all of the actions that the AI performs, including accidental file deletions. AI is a powerful tool. Use it responsibly and carefully.


## Installation

```
pip install jupyter-extension-sigmund
```


## Usage

First load the extension with a magic command:

```
%load_ext jupyter_extension_sigmund
```

Next, start listening for Sigmund with another magic command:

```
%start_listening
```

Once the extension is listening, all you need to do is open https://sigmundai.eu in a browser. A connection will then automatically be established.
