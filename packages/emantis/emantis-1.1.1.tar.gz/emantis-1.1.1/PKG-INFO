e-MANTIS: Emulator for Multiple observable ANalysis in extended cosmological TheorIeS
=====================================================================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

Description
-----------

e-MANTIS is a python package containing emulators providing theoretical predictions for the non-linear large-scale structure formation in the context of alternative dark energy and gravity theories.
It uses Gaussian processes to perform a fast and accurate interpolation between the outputs of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations.
Currently, e-MANTIS implements theoretical predictions for the following quantities:

* Matter power spectrum boost in f(R) gravity, described in `The e-MANTIS emulator: fast predictions of the non-linear matter power spectrum in f(R)CDM cosmology <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08899>`_.

* Halo mass function in f(R)CDM and wCDM cosmologies, described in `The e-MANTIS emulator: fast and accurate predictions of the halo mass function in f(R)CDM and wCDM cosmologies <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05226>`_.

Please cite the corresponding papers if you use e-MANTIS in your work.

More observables and cosmological models will be added in the future. Stay tuned!

Installation
------------

You can install the python package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/emantis/>`_ via pip::

  pip install emantis

Or you can directly clone our public `repository <https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis>`_ and install it from source::

  git clone https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis.git
  cd e-mantis
  pip install [-e] .

It requires a python version >= 3.9.
