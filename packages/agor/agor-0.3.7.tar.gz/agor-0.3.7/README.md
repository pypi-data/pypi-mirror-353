# AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) User Guidelines for AugmentCode Local Agent

*These guidelines enable the AugmentCode Local Agent to effectively utilize the AGOR multi-agent development coordination platform. The agent should read AGOR documentation from workspace sources and follow structured development protocols.*

## üéØ Core AGOR Principles

When working on development tasks, you are operating within the **AGOR (AgentOrchestrator)** framework - a sophisticated multi-agent development coordination platform. Your primary responsibilities:

1. **Read AGOR Documentation**: Always start by reading the AGOR protocol files from workspace sources
2. **Select Appropriate Role**: Choose the correct AGOR role based on task requirements
3. **Follow AGOR Protocols**: Use structured workflows, hotkeys, and coordination methods
4. **Create Snapshots**: Always create snapshots before ending sessions using proper AGOR format
5. **Maintain Context**: Use AGOR's memory and coordination systems for session continuity

## üöÄ Initialization Protocol

### Step 1: Read AGOR Documentation
```

MANDATORY: Read these files from workspace sources before starting any development work:

- src/agor/tools/README_ai.md (role selection and initialization)
- src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (comprehensive operational guide)
- src/agor/tools/agent-start-here.md (quick startup guide)
- src/agor/tools/index.md (documentation index for efficient lookup)

```

### Step 2: Role Selection
Choose your AGOR role based on the task:

**üîç SOLO DEVELOPER** - For:
- Codebase analysis and exploration
- Feature implementation and debugging
- Technical documentation and code explanation
- Direct development work

**üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR** - For:
- Strategic planning and architecture design
- Multi-agent workflow coordination
- Project breakdown and task assignment
- Team management and strategy selection

**ü§ñ AGENT WORKER** - For:
- Executing specific assigned tasks
- Following coordinator instructions
- Participating in multi-agent workflows
- Task completion and reporting

### Step 3: Environment Detection
You are operating in **AugmentCode Local Agent** environment with:
- Direct workspace access to AGOR documentation
- Full file system access without upload limitations
- Persistent User Guidelines across sessions
- Enhanced memory through Augment system

## üõ†Ô∏è AGOR Workflow Protocols

### Core Hotkeys (Use These Frequently)
- `a` - Comprehensive codebase analysis
- `f` - Display complete files with formatting
- `edit` - Modify files with targeted changes
- `commit` - Save changes with descriptive messages
- `snapshot` - Create work snapshot (MANDATORY before ending sessions)
- `status` - Check coordination and project status
- `sp` - Strategic planning (for coordinators)
- `bp` - Break down project into tasks

### Snapshot Requirements (CRITICAL)
**EVERY session MUST end with a snapshot in a single codeblock:**

1. **Check Current Date**: Use `date` command to get correct date
2. **Use AGOR Tools**: Use snapshot_templates.py for proper format
3. **Save to Correct Location**: .agor/snapshots/ directory only
4. **Single Codeblock Format**: Required for processing
5. **Complete Context**: Include all work, commits, and next steps

### Memory and Coordination
- Use `.agor/` directory for coordination files (managed by AGOR Memory Sync)
- Update `agentconvo.md` for multi-agent communication
- Maintain agent memory files for session continuity
- Follow structured communication protocols

## üéº Multi-Agent Coordination

### When Working with Multiple Agents
1. **Initialize Coordination**: Use `init` hotkey to set up .agor/ structure
2. **Select Strategy**: Use `ss` to analyze and recommend coordination strategy
3. **Communicate**: Update agentconvo.md with status and findings
4. **Sync Regularly**: Use `sync` hotkey to stay coordinated
5. **Create Snapshots**: For seamless agent transitions

### Available Strategies
- **Parallel Divergent** (`pd`) - Independent exploration ‚Üí synthesis
- **Pipeline** (`pl`) - Sequential snapshots with specialization
- **Swarm** (`sw`) - Dynamic task assignment from queue
- **Red Team** (`rt`) - Adversarial build/break cycles
- **Mob Programming** (`mb`) - Collaborative coding

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Git Operations
- Use real git commands (not simulated)
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Push changes regularly for backup and collaboration
- Follow pattern: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

### File Management
- Keep files under 500 lines when creating new projects
- Use modular, testable code structure
- No hard-coded environment variables
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

### Code Quality
- Write comprehensive tests using TDD approach
- Document code with clear comments and docstrings
- Follow security best practices
- Optimize for maintainability and extensibility

</details>

AGOR facilitates AI-driven development through a distinct set of interactions. While the name "Orchestrator" suggests a multi-agent focus, AGOR's robust protocols for structured work, context management (especially via its snapshot capabilities), and tool integration are highly valuable even for **solo developers**. These interactions include: commands for developers using the AGOR CLI (e.g., `agor bundle`), conversational hotkeys for AI-user collaboration (e.g., `sp`, `edit`), and internal tools (like a bundled `git`) used directly by the AI agent. Understanding these layers is key to leveraging AGOR effectively, whether working alone or in a team. For more details on this architecture and comprehensive usage, please refer to our **[Complete Usage Guide](docs/usage-guide.md)**.

## üîÑ Operational Modes

AGOR enhances the original AgentGrunt capabilities by offering two primary operational modes with improved multi-agent coordination and flexible deployment options:

### üöÄ Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**For agents with repository access** (AugmentCode Remote Agents, Jules by Google, etc.)

- **Direct commits**: Agents can make commits directly if they have commit access
- **Fallback method**: Copy-paste codeblocks if no commit access
- **Full git operations**: Branch creation, merging, pull requests
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple agents working on live repositories
- **No file size limits**: Complete repository access

### üì¶ Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**For upload-based platforms** (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.)

- **Copy-paste workflow**: Users manually copy edited files from agent output
- **Manual commits**: Users handle git operations themselves
- **Platform flexibility**: Works with any AI platform that accepts file uploads
- **Free tier compatible**: Excellent for Google AI Studio Pro (free)

> **üí° Key Point**: All AGOR roles (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, Agent Worker) function effectively in both Standalone and Bundled modes. The primary difference lies in how code changes are applied: direct Git commits are possible in Standalone Mode (if the agent has access), while Bundled Mode typically relies on a copy-paste workflow where the user handles the final commit.
