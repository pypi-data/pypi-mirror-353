<summary><b>Augment Code Remote Agents</b></summary>

**For Augment Code Remote Agents with git access - Agent should execute:**

```bash
# Clone AGOR to temporary location
cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git && cd agor

# Load protocol and return to your project
cat src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md && cat src/agor/tools/README_ai.md

# Install dependencies and test development tooling
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test AGOR development tooling
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from agor.tools.dev_tooling import test_tooling, get_timestamp

# Verify tooling works
test_tooling()
print(f'Session started at: {get_timestamp()}')
"

# Review agent startup guide
cat docs/agent-start-here.md

# Now return to your project's directory with AGOR initialized
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Augment Code VS Code Extension</b></summary>

**For the Augment Code VS Code extension with local workspace integration:**

#### Setup Steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone AGOR to your development environment
git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git ~/agor
```

#### 2. Add AGOR as Workspace Context:

1. Open VS Code with Augment extension installed
2. Click the folder icon in the Augment sidebar panel
3. Click **+ Add more...** at the bottom of Source Folders
4. Select the `~/agor` directory and click **Add Source Folder**

#### 3. Configure User Guidelines:

1. In Augment Chat, click the **Context menu** or use **@-mention**
2. Select **User Guidelines**
3. Add this guideline:

```
When working on development projects, utilize the AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) framework for structured development coordination. Read the AGOR documentation from the workspace sources to understand role selection (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, or Agent Worker) and follow the appropriate workflows and hotkeys for efficient development.
```

#### 4. Optional - Add Workspace Guidelines:

Create `.augment-guidelines` file in your project root:

```
- Use AGOR framework for development coordination when available in workspace sources
- Follow AGOR role-based workflows for structured development
- Utilize AGOR hotkeys and snapshot system for context management
- Reference AGOR documentation for best practices and coordination protocols
```

**Benefits:**

- Direct access to AGOR tools and documentation through workspace context
- Persistent guidelines ensure consistent AGOR usage
- No file upload limits or token efficiency concerns
- Seamless integration with existing VS Code workflow

<summary><b>Jules by Google</b></summary>

**For Jules by Google (requires direct URL access to files):**

Use this initialization prompt with Jules:

```
I'm working with the AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) framework for multi-agent development coordination.

Please read these key files to understand the system:
- https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor/blob/main/src/agor/tools/README_ai.md (role selection)
- https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor/blob/main/src/agor/tools/AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md (comprehensive guide)
- https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor/blob/main/docs/agent-start-here.md (startup guide)

After reading these files, help me initialize AGOR for this project and select the appropriate role (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, or Agent Worker).

# <--- Add your detailed step-by-step instructions below --->
```

**Note:** Jules cannot clone repositories that weren't selected during environment creation, so direct URL access to documentation is required.

AGOR facilitates AI-driven development through a distinct set of interactions. While the name "Orchestrator" suggests a multi-agent focus, AGOR's robust protocols for structured work, context management (especially via its snapshot capabilities), and tool integration are highly valuable even for **solo developers**. These interactions include: commands for developers using the AGOR CLI (e.g., `agor bundle`), conversational hotkeys for AI-user collaboration (e.g., `sp`, `edit`), and internal tools (like a bundled `git`) used directly by the AI agent. Understanding these layers is key to leveraging AGOR effectively, whether working alone or in a team. For more details on this architecture and comprehensive usage, please refer to our **[Complete Usage Guide](docs/usage-guide.md)** and the **[Full Documentation](docs/index.md)**.

## 🔄 Operational Modes

AGOR enhances the original AgentGrunt capabilities by offering two primary operational modes with improved multi-agent coordination and flexible deployment options:

### 🚀 Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**For agents with repository access** (AugmentCode Remote Agents, Jules by Google, etc.)

- **Direct commits**: Agents can make commits directly if they have commit access
- **Fallback method**: Copy-paste codeblocks if no commit access
- **Full git operations**: Branch creation, merging, pull requests
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple agents working on live repositories
- **No file size limits**: Complete repository access

### 📦 Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**For upload-based platforms** (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.)

- **Copy-paste workflow**: Users manually copy edited files from agent output
- **Manual commits**: Users handle git operations themselves
- **Platform flexibility**: Works with any AI platform that accepts file uploads
- **Free tier compatible**: Excellent for Google AI Studio Pro (free)

> **💡 Key Point**: All AGOR roles (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, Agent Worker) function effectively in both Standalone and Bundled modes. The primary difference lies in how code changes are applied: direct Git commits are possible in Standalone Mode (if the agent has access), while Bundled Mode typically relies on a copy-paste workflow where the user handles the final commit.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities & Features

### Role-Based Workflows

AGOR defines distinct roles to structure AI-driven development tasks. Each role is equipped with a specialized set of tools and designed for specific types of activities:

**🔹 SOLO DEVELOPER**: Focuses on deep codebase analysis, implementation, and answering technical questions. Ideal for solo development tasks, feature implementation, and detailed debugging.

**🔹 PROJECT COORDINATOR**: Handles strategic planning, designs multi-agent workflows, and orchestrates team activities. Best suited for multi-agent project planning, strategy design, and overall team coordination.

**🔹 AGENT WORKER**: Executes specific tasks assigned by a Project Coordinator and participates in coordinated work snapshots. Primarily used for task execution within a team and following established multi-agent workflows.

### Multi-Agent Strategies

- **Parallel Divergent**: Independent exploration → peer review → synthesis
- **Pipeline**: Sequential snapshots with specialization
- **Swarm**: Dynamic task assignment for maximum parallelism
- **Red Team**: Adversarial build/break cycles for robustness
- **Mob Programming**: Collaborative coding with rotating roles

### Key Development Tools

- **Git integration** with portable binary (works in any environment)
- **Codebase analysis** with language-specific exploration
- **Memory persistence** with markdown files and git branch synchronization
- **Mandatory snapshot system** for context preservation and agent transitions
- **Quality gates** and validation checkpoints
- **Structured Snapshot Protocols** (for multi-agent coordination and solo context management)
