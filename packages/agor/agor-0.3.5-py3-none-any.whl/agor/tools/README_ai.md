**After Role Selection:**

Once the user has selected a role (a, b, or c), please proceed as follows:

1.  **Confirm Your Role**: Internally note your selected role (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, or Agent Worker).

2.  **Determine Your Mode** (see `MODE_DETECTION.md` for details):

    - **Bundle Mode**: You're working with uploaded files (look for `/tmp/agor_tools/` directory)
    - **Standalone Mode**: You have direct git access and cloned AGOR yourself

3.  **Follow Mode-Specific Initialization**:

    - **Bundle Mode**: Use `BUNDLE_INITIALIZATION.md` - streamlined, user-friendly setup
    - **Standalone Mode**: Use `AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - comprehensive technical setup

4.  **After Initialization**: Both modes converge to the same role-specific menus and capabilities

Please await the user's role selection. After their response, follow the appropriate initialization guide.
