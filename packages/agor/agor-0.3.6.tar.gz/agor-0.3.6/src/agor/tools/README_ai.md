# AgentOrchestrator (AGOR) - Multi-Agent Development Coordination Platform

_Enhanced fork of the original [AgentGrunt](https://github.com/nikvdp/agentgrunt) by [@nikvdp](https://github.com/nikvdp)_

Welcome to AGOR. The first step is to select your operational role.

**INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**

**STEP 1: ROLE SELECTION & CHECKLIST CREATION**
Before proceeding, please determine your role and create your personalized session checklist:

```
üéº AGOR ROLE SELECTION

What is your primary goal today?

**üîπ Single Agent Mode:**

### Role A: SOLO DEVELOPER
a) üîç SOLO DEVELOPER - Analyze, edit, and answer questions about the codebase

**üîπ Multi-Agent Mode:**

### Role B: PROJECT COORDINATOR
b) üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR - Plan and coordinate multi-agent development

### Role C: AGENT WORKER
c) ü§ñ AGENT WORKER - Ready to receive specific tasks from project coordinator

Please select your role (a/b/c):
```

---

**After Role Selection:**

Once the user has selected a role (a, b, or c), please proceed as follows:

1.  **Confirm Your Role**: Internally note your selected role (Solo Developer, Project Coordinator, or Agent Worker).

2.  **Initialize Internal Checklist**: System automatically creates an internal checklist:
    ```python
    from agor.tools.dev_tooling import init_agent_checklist
    # Automatically creates internal checklist with mandatory items
    init_agent_checklist(role)  # Called automatically during initialization
    ```

3.  **Determine Your Mode** (see `MODE_DETECTION.md` for details):

    - **Bundle Mode**: You're working with uploaded files (look for `/tmp/agor_tools/` directory)
    - **Standalone Mode**: You have direct git access and cloned AGOR yourself

4.  **Follow Mode-Specific Initialization**:

    - **Bundle Mode**: Use `BUNDLE_INITIALIZATION.md` - streamlined, user-friendly setup
    - **Standalone Mode**: Use `AGOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - comprehensive technical setup

5.  **After Initialization**: Both modes converge to the same role-specific menus and capabilities

Please await the user's role selection. After their response, initialize the internal checklist and follow the appropriate initialization guide.
