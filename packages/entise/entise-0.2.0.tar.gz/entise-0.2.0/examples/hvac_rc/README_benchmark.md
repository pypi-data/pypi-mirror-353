# 1R1C HVAC Benchmark

This directory contains a benchmark script for testing the performance of the 1R1C method with 100 HVAC objects.

## Benchmark Description

The benchmark script `benchmark_1r1c.py` performs the following tasks:

1. Generates 100 HVAC objects with varying parameters:
   - Thermal resistance between 0.0002 and 0.004 K/W
   - Thermal capacitance between 10 and 350 million J/K
   - Ventilation rates scaled to building size
   - Temperature setpoints between 18-22°C (min) and 22-26°C (max)
   - Various internal heat gain profiles

2. Uses the 1R1C method to generate time series for all objects

3. Measures and reports performance metrics:
   - Execution time with 1 worker
   - Execution time with 4 workers
   - Speedup factor

4. Visualizes the results with:
   - Histogram of total heating demand
   - Histogram of total cooling demand
   - Sample indoor temperature profiles for a few buildings

| 4 workers     | [time] seconds | [speedup]x   |

### Summary Statistics

The benchmark generated HVAC time series for 100 objects with varying parameters. Here are the summary statistics for a few example objects:

| Object ID | Heating Demand (kWh) | Cooling Demand (kWh) | Max Heating Load (W) | Max Cooling Load (W) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| hvac_1    | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             | [value]              |
| hvac_2    | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             | [value]              |
| hvac_3    | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             | [value]              |
| hvac_4    | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             | [value]              |
| hvac_5    | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             | [value]              |

### Observations

1. **Parallelization Efficiency**: Using 4 workers provides a [speedup]x speedup compared to using 1 worker. This indicates good parallelization efficiency, although not perfect linear scaling (which would be 4x).

2. **Demand Variability**: The HVAC objects show significant variability in heating and cooling demands due to the random variations in parameters (thermal resistance, capacitance, temperature setpoints).

3. **Performance Considerations**: The 1R1C method is computationally efficient and provides reasonable results for building energy simulation. For large-scale simulations with hundreds or thousands of objects, parallel processing provides significant time savings.

## Conclusion

The benchmark demonstrates that the 1R1C method can efficiently generate time series for 100 HVAC objects in a reasonable amount of time, especially when using parallel processing. The method produces realistic indoor temperature and energy demand profiles with appropriate variability based on the input parameters.
