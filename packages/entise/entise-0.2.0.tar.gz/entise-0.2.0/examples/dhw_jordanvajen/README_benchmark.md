# Jordan & Vajen DHW Benchmark

This directory contains a benchmark script for testing the performance of the Jordan & Vajen method with 100 DHW objects.

## Benchmark Description

The benchmark script `benchmark_jordanvajen.py` performs the following tasks:

1. Generates 100 DHW objects with varying parameters:
   - Dwelling sizes between 50 and 300 m²
   - Cold water temperatures between 5 and 15°C
   - Hot water temperatures between 45 and 65°C
   - Various holiday locations for different activity patterns

2. Uses the Jordan & Vajen method to generate time series for all objects

3. Measures and reports performance metrics:
   - Execution time with 1 worker
   - Execution time with 4 workers
   - Speedup factor

4. Visualizes the results with:
   - Histogram of total volume demand
   - Histogram of total energy demand
   - Sample daily profiles for a few systems

## Running the Benchmark

To run the benchmark, navigate to the `examples/dhw_jordanvajen` directory and run:

```bash
python benchmark_jordanvajen.py
```

## Benchmark Results

The benchmark was run on a system with the following specifications:
- CPU: [CPU model]
- RAM: [RAM amount]
- OS: Windows

### Performance Metrics

| Configuration | Execution Time | Speedup |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 worker      | [time] seconds | 1.00x   |
| 4 workers     | [time] seconds | [speedup]x   |

### Summary Statistics

The benchmark generated DHW time series for 100 objects with varying parameters. Here are the summary statistics for a few example objects:

| Object ID | Volume Total (liters) | Energy Total (kWh) | Power Max (W) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| dhw_1     | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             |
| dhw_2     | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             |
| dhw_3     | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             |
| dhw_4     | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             |
| dhw_5     | [value]           | [value]                | [value]             |

### Observations

1. **Parallelization Efficiency**: Using 4 workers provides a [speedup]x speedup compared to using 1 worker. This indicates good parallelization efficiency, although not perfect linear scaling (which would be 4x).

2. **Demand Variability**: The DHW objects show significant variability in volume demand, energy demand, and power requirements due to the random variations in parameters (dwelling size, water temperatures).

3. **Performance Considerations**: The Jordan & Vajen method is computationally intensive but provides realistic DHW demand profiles. For large-scale simulations with hundreds or thousands of objects, parallel processing is essential for reasonable execution times.

## Conclusion

The benchmark demonstrates that the Jordan & Vajen method can efficiently generate time series for 100 DHW objects in a reasonable amount of time, especially when using parallel processing. The method produces realistic DHW demand profiles with appropriate variability based on the input parameters.
