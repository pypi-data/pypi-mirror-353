STIS Target Acquisition Simulator -- Release 1

The following bugs have been addressed:

 2. 24-Feb-97		tas.h					RAShaw

The definition of TAS_FTP_PATH had been set to a world-writable directory 
on /data/vega3, which of course broke when vega was moved from the ra 
server to tib.  This of course broke the test version of the TAS on ra.  
The definition has been revised, although this should really be established 
via a compiler switch.  

 1. 24-Feb-97		tas_getirafimage.c			RAShaw

The pixel scale was being incorrectly calculated.  This was fixed in the 
routine getImageScale.  The bug, and the fix, only affect the reported 
pixel scale (and possibly the generation of a warning message), but it 
does not affect the validity of the computed target position.
