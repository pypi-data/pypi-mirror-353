const _description: string = "DeepHermes 3 (Mistral 24B Preview) is an instruction-tuned language model by Nous Research based on Mistral-Small-24B, designed for chat, function calling, and advanced multi-turn reasoning. It introduces a dual-mode system that toggles between intuitive chat responses and structured 'deep reasoning' mode using special system prompts. Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications. DeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *'deep thinking'* modeâ€”generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer.  System Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem."
