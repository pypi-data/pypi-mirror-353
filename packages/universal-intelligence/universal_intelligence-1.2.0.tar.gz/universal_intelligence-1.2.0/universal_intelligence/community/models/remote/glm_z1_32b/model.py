        "GLM-Z1-32B-0414 is an enhanced reasoning variant of GLM-4-32B, built for deep mathematical, logical, and code-oriented problem solving. It applies extended reinforcement learningâ€”both task-specific and general pairwise preference-basedâ€”to improve performance on complex multi-step tasks. Compared to the base GLM-4-32B model, Z1 significantly boosts capabilities in structured reasoning and formal domains. The model supports enforced 'thinking' steps via prompt engineering and offers improved coherence for long-form outputs. It's optimized for use in agentic workflows, and includes support for long context (via YaRN), JSON tool calling, and fine-grained sampling configuration for stable inference. Ideal for use cases requiring deliberate, multi-step reasoning or formal derivations."
