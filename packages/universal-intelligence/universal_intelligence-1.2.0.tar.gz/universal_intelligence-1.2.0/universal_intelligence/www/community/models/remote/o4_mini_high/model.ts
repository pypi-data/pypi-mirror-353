const _name: string = "openai/o4-mini-high"
const _description: string = "OpenAI o4-mini-high is the same model as [o4-mini](/openai/o4-mini) with reasoning_effort set to high.  OpenAI o4-mini is a compact reasoning model in the o-series, optimized for fast, cost-efficient performance while retaining strong multimodal and agentic capabilities. It supports tool use and demonstrates competitive reasoning and coding performance across benchmarks like AIME (99.5% with Python) and SWE-bench, outperforming its predecessor o3-mini and even approaching o3 in some domains. Despite its smaller size, o4-mini exhibits high accuracy in STEM tasks, visual problem solving (e.g., MathVista, MMMU), and code editing. It is especially well-suited for high-throughput scenarios where latency or cost is critical. Thanks to its efficient architecture and refined reinforcement learning training, o4-mini can chain tools, generate structured outputs, and solve multi-step tasks with minimal delayâ€”often in under a minute."
