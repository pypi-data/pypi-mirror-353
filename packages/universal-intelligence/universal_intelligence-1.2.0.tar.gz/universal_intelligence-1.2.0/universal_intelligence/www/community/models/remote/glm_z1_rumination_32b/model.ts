const _name: string = "thudm/glm-z1-rumination-32b"
const _description: string = "THUDM: GLM Z1 Rumination 32B is a 32B-parameter deep reasoning model from the GLM-4-Z1 series, optimized for complex, open-ended tasks requiring prolonged deliberation. It builds upon glm-4-32b-0414 with additional reinforcement learning phases and multi-stage alignment strategies, introducing 'rumination' capabilities designed to emulate extended cognitive processing. This includes iterative reasoning, multi-hop analysis, and tool-augmented workflows such as search, retrieval, and citation-aware synthesis. The model excels in research-style writing, comparative analysis, and intricate question answering. It supports function calling for search and navigation primitives (`search`, `click`, `open`, `finish`), enabling use in agent-style pipelines. Rumination behavior is governed by multi-turn loops with rule-based reward shaping and delayed decision mechanisms, benchmarked against Deep Research frameworks such as OpenAI's internal alignment stacks. This variant is suitable for scenarios requiring depth over speed."
