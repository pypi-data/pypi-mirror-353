# DI2008-Python

## About
Interface for the DI-2008 in Python.

Modified from original interface in Python by DATAQ Instruments under MIT License

Maintainer: Clark Hensley ch3136@msstate.edu

## Getting Started
Install via pip from PyPI:
```sh
pip install di2008-python
```

Instantiate DI2008 Object with Dictionary of Parameters:
```py
from di2008_python import DI2008, DI2008Channels, DI2008Layout, DI2008TCType

# Enable the DI-2008 with a K-Type thermocopule in Analog Channel 1, an N-Type Thermocouple in Analog Channel 3, and the Digital Channel active
di2008 = DI2008({
    <DI-2008 SERIAL NUMBER>: {
        DI2008Channels.CH1: (DI2008Layout.TC, DI2008TCType.K),
        DI2008Channels.CH3: (DI2008Layout.TC, DI2008TCType.N),
        DI2008UseDigital: True,
        }
    },
)
```

This interface uses named enumerations to ensure that what settings are being used is clear and concise

A path to a .toml or .json file can also be passed in, formatted with the same names:
```toml
[<DI-2008 SERIAL NUMBER>]
"DI2008Channels.CH1" = ["DI2008Layout.TC", "DI2008TCType.K"]
"DI2008Channels.CH3" = ["DI2008Layout.TC", "DI2008TCType.N"]
"DI2008UseDigital" = true
```
(Note that toml format will treat the dotted names like DI2008Channels.CH1 as dictionaries, so they must be in quotes. The parser does handle variations in capitalization, spacing, or use of hyphens and underscores)

## Current Features:
* Thermocouples
* ADC Reading
* Digital Reading
* Changing Scan Rate, Decimation, and Filtering Mode
* Automatic ChannelStretch Synchronized Initialization
* Reading configuration from .json/.toml files as well as raw Python dictionaries

## Planned Features:
* Changing Packet Rate Size
* Interface with the `info` operator
* Enforce cleanup on stopping
* CJCDelta
* Rate Measurement
* LED Color
* Specify Digital Input as well as Output
