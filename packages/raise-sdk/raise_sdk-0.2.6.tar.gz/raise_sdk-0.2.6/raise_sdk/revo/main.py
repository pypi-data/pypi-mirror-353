    """
    Orchestrates the execution of a processing script, with or without Docker, based on user input and system configuration.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Prompts the user to select necessary input files (script(s), requirements, and dataset(s)) if missing.
    2. Initializes the `LocalCodeRunner` class with the selected files and the Docker image configuration parameters.
    3. Checks the connection to the Docker daemon and handles the user's response if Docker is unavailable.
    4. Prepares the environment for running the experiment, including setting up the experiment path and building the Docker image if Docker is available.
    5. Executes the experiment either within a Docker container (using the provided programming language and version for the image)
       or as a regular Python script using the local system configuration.
    6. Logs the execution time and status of the experiment.
    7. Verifies the experiment results.
    8. Cleans up resources by removing the Docker image (if used) and any temporary files created during the execution.

    Parameters:
        script (list of str, optional): A list of paths to the script file(s). If not provided, the user will be prompted to select it.
        requirements (list of str, optional): A list of paths to the `requirements.txt` file(s). If not provided, the user will be prompted to select it.
        dataset (list of str, optional): A list of paths to the dataset file(s). If not provided, the user will be prompted to select it.
        programming_language (str, optional): The programming language used to create the Docker image.
        version (str, optional): The version of the programming language or runtime to be used in the Docker image.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If Docker is unavailable and the user opts not to proceed with local execution.
    
    Notes:
        - The experiment can be run either inside a Docker container or as a regular Python script, depending on the availability of Docker.
            - When Docker is unavailable, the experiment will run using the local system configuration.
        - The execution time and status of the experiment are logged.
        - Temporary files and Docker images (if used) are cleaned up after the experiment finishes.
