        Therefore, we can use the `get_overlap` method to obtain the precise length of the overlapping interval:
        >>> period1.get_overlap(period2)
        TimePeriod(start=datetime.time(10, 0), end=datetime.time(12, 0))
        And since the overlap is always the same, regardless of the observer, the opposite action would have the same

        intervals.

        Take, for example, the following two periods:
        >>> period1_start = datetime(2024, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0)

        >>> period2 = DatetimePeriod(start=period2_start, end=period2_end)
        >>> period1

        DatetimePeriod(start=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 10, 0), end=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 13, 0))

        On a timeline, the two periods can be illustrated as:
           0800              Period 1                1200

        From the point of view of Period 1, the disconnect between the two periods is between the time 0800 and 1000;
        however, from the point of view of Period 2, the disconnect between them is between the time 1200 and 1300.

        Therefore, if you want to obtain the amount of time when the periods do NOT overlap as relative to Period 1,
        you should use:
        >>> period1.get_disconnect(period2)
        DatetimePeriod(start=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 8, 0), end=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 10, 0))

        But if you want to obtain the same as relative to Period 2 instead:
        >>> period2.get_disconnect(period1)
        DatetimePeriod(start=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0), end=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 13, 0))
