## Usage

### üíª Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage with a single image
yandex-ris -i image.jpg -o output_dir

# Process all images in a directory
yandex-ris -i images_folder -o output_dir

# Process images from a URL
yandex-ris -i https://example.com/image.jpg -o output_dir

# Process images from a list file
yandex-ris -i image_list.txt -o output_dir

# With custom options
yandex-ris -i input_path -o output_dir -m 200 -w 4 -t 8
```

### Configuration

- `--input`, `-i`: Input path (file, directory or URL) (required)
- `--output`, `-o`: Output root directory (default: downloaded_images)
- `--max-images`, `-m`: Maximum images to download per source (default: 100)
- `--pause-time`, `-p`: Page load wait time in seconds (default: 7)
- `--workers`, `-w`: Number of parallel processing workers (default: 2)
- `--download-threads`, `-t`: Download threads per process (default: 4)
- `--log-level`: Logging level (default: INFO)

### üìù Input Types

The tool supports multiple input types:
1. Single image file (e.g., `image.jpg`)
2. Directory containing images (will recursively scan for images)
3. Image URL (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`)
4. Text file containing a list of paths/URLs (one per line)

### üêç Python API

```python
from yandex_ris import YandexImageCrawler

crawler = YandexImageCrawler(
    output_dir="downloaded_images",
    max_images=100,
    workers=4,
    download_threads=4
)

# Process a single image
crawler.process_images(["path/to/image.jpg"])

# Process multiple images
crawler.process_images([
    "path/to/image1.jpg",
    "path/to/image2.jpg",
    "https://example.com/image.jpg"
])
```

## TODO

- [ ] Support downloading original/full-size images instead of thumbnails
- [ ] Add proxy support to bypass regional restrictions and reduce the risk of IP bans
- [ ] Improve robustness against Yandex's anti-scraping mechanisms:
