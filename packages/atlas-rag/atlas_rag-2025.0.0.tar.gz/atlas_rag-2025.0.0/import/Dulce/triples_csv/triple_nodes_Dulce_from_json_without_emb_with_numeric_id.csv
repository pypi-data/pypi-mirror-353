"Intuition,' they mirrored thoughtfully. 'I guess sometimes the numbers don't have all the answers.'",event,[],[],74,Node
"As Alex turned to leave, Sam's eyes drifted back to the screens, now seeing them not as barriers to isolate behind, but as windows into the vast and enigmatic challenge that awaited their team.",event,[],[],75,Node
"Outside the office, the persistent buzz of activity in the facility belied the unease that gripped its inhabitants.",event,[],[],76,Node

"Then, as one, they stepped into the elevator.",event,[],[],117,Node

Dr. Jordan Hayes couldn't help but muse over the layers of data that could wait below.,event,[],[],119,Node
