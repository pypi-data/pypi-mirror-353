# ChessPuzzleKit
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ChessPuzzleKit.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ChessPuzzleKit/)

**ChessPuzzleKit** is a Python library for accessing and working with chess puzzles from the [Lichess puzzle database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles). It provides functionality to retrieve unique puzzles by theme types, rating, and popularity, all with zero setup.

## Features

- Automatically downloads and caches a Lichess puzzle database (almost 5 million puzzles, ~900 MB)
- Filter puzzles by:
  - Theme (e.g. `fork`, `pin`, `mateIn2`, etc.)
  - Rating or popularity range
- Returns puzzles as Python dictionaries

## Installation
You can install this package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ChessPuzzleKit/):
```bash
pip install ChessPuzzleKit
```

## Usage
```py
import ChessPuzzleKit as cpk

# Optional: use custom sqlite database or CSV file
custom_db_path = cpk.create_db_csv("/path/to/local_csv_file.csv")
cpk.set_db_path(custom_db_path)

# Or, locally download the database if it doesn't exist
# By default, the database gets downloaded to .chess_puzzles in the HOME directory
cpk.get_connnection()

puzzles = cpk.get_puzzle(themes=['fork'], ratingRange=[2000, 2200], count=3)
themes = cpk.get_all_themes()
print(themes)

for p in puzzles:
    print(p['fen'], p['moves'], p['rating'])
```
