    """
    A persistent basic FIFO queue implemented using LMDB.

    Multiple producer processes can be running concurrently. (Read further.)

    Only one consumer process is allowed if the queue consumption is done
    using 'get/remove' methods. Running multiple consumer processes
    concurrently in such a case will most probably lead to the queue
    corruption and must be avoided.

    Multiple consumer processes can be running concurrently, but only in case
    they all consume the queue using the 'pop' method only. (The 'pop' method
    gets and removes items from the queue within a single transaction.)

    Both producer and consumer processes are the queue writers and
    therefore will in fact interact with the queue sequentially, as LMDB
    allows only one writer at a time.
