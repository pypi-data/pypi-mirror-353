# cnn-lib

CNN tools and scripts to be used by projects at CTU GeoForAll lab.

The tools started as source code accompanying [this PhD project](https://github.com/ctu-geoforall-lab-projects/phd-pesek-2024/tree/master). By the time and meanwhile, the code started to be used also for other projects of the lab. In order to keep the code frozen at the moment of the defense of the thesis, any further development since Nov 2024 happens here.
