If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

# Monitizer

<img src="images/monitizer-logo.png" width="100">

We create a tool (Monitizer) that optimizes and evaluates monitors for a neural network (NN) for a specific task.

## Documentation

A full documentation is available online at https://monitizer.readthedocs.io/.
This also contains setup requirements, an installation guide, a dveloper guide and detailed explanations of the
structure of the project.

## Installation

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install monitizer
```

### Install from source

Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/live-lab/software/monitizer
cd monitizer
pip install .
```

**Note** that if you want to debug and change the code run the command ``pip install -e .`` to install in development
mode!

Finally, decide which ID-datasets you will be using (you can also do this again later) and download the datasets by
running:

```bash
monitizer --setup <dataset1> ... <datasetN> --data-folder <PATH/TO/DATA>
```

while replacing `<dataset>` with the name of a dataset that you intend to use, e.g. `./monitizer --setup MNIST CIFAR10`
and `<PATH/TO/DATA>` with a folder, where you want the raw data to be stored (default is 'data').
This will automatically download all required datasets, including the respective OOD-datasets, that monitizer needs.

A default command for downloading all implemented datasets is:

```bash
monitizer --setup ALL --data-folder data
```

Note that Imagenet must be downloaded after logging in, so Monitizer cannot take this over for you.
However, it will tell you, where to download the data and where to put it.
Visit https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/2012-downloads.php for downloading ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz,
ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar, and ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz, and put it in your data folder.

### Your first command

Run:

```bash
# assuming you are in the directory Monitizer
monitizer --evaluate --monitor-template energy --dataset MNIST --neural-network example-networks/MNIST3x100 --optimize --optimization-objective optimization-objective.ini
```

It optimizes an Energy monitor [(2)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88494-9_14) on a network
called "MNIST3x100", trained on the MNIST dataset. The optimization is random and the resulting monitor is then to be
evaluated.

## Running Tests

`python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## Lincense
