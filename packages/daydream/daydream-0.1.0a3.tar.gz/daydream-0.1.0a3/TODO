move to: uvx daydream configure, as a first step that figures out plugins
- run this first
- go through plugin install
--> ensure each plugin has basic auth that works
- ask what clients they want to configure (Claude, Amazon Q)
- maybe run the build graph
- then ask if they want to (re)launch Claude now


make sure daydream works with:
- config.yaml that doesn't have plugins.aws.settings key (i.e. that's an empty dict)
- no aws access
- handle TokenRetrievalError (`aws sso logout`)

turn off logs by default in `client configure claude`

README:
- document installation
- document client setup
- document plugins
- document config.yaml
- move to `uvx daydream` commands in README

Ensure the install process works
--> maybe make a test runner?
--> https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/testing/
--> https://python-cli-test-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other.html#click-cli-testing

metrics retrieval can easily blow out the context

how are the requests performing for the workithealth-webwc-sadwxn lb? start with by searching for that id




- Add HOME env var to the client configure mcp config (aws creds will need it)
- make sure client configure --profile= works

Bug bash notes:
- README: `uvx daydream` doesn't work until we publish to pip :(
- people ran into issues with the space in application support folder name when creating the claude config
--> `daydream mcp configure claude` will help!
- people also ran into issues with the /path/to/repo in the MCP claude config
--> `daydream mcp configure claude` will help!
- people were unable to build graph due to access denied errors
- alex wasn't sure what to do once claude was open and mcp was working
- doing customer exploration requires `aptible impersonate`
--> https://github.com/aptible/aptible-impersonate
- failed to get metrics, then made up metrics LOL
--> specific error in logs: `Error calling tool 'get_metrics_for_node'` when getting metrics for an aptible app.
--> from Marc: https://claude.ai/share/05f10a06-fa59-451b-a171-7ceb0392d65a
--> from Alex: https://aptible.slack.com/files/U08N0786S5P/F08TGHW7BBL/image.png
- people didn't know where to look when mcp ran into an error
--> maybe `daydream mcp logs claude` ???
