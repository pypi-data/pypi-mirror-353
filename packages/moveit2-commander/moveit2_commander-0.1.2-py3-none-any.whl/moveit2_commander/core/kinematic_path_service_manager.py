        ServiceManager for the MoveIt2 Kinematic Path service.
        This class is responsible for managing the service that computes a kinematic path

        Parameters:
        - node (Node): The ROS2 Node instance.
        - planning_group (str): The name of the planning group for which to compute the kinematic path.
          Defaults to "ur_manipulator".
        - *args, **kwargs: Additional arguments for future extensibility.

        Static Method:
        - get_goal_constraint: A static method to create a goal constraint from a JointState instance.
          It takes the desired joint states and an optional tolerance value, returning a Constraints object.
