VulnerableCode is a free and open database of open source software package
vulnerabilities **because open source software vulnerabilities data and tools
should be free and open source themselves**:

we are trying to change this and evolve the status quo in a few other areas!

- Vulnerability databases have been **traditionally proprietary** even though they
  are mostly about free and open source software. 

- Vulnerability databases also often contain a lot of lesser value data which
  means a lot of false positive signals that require extensive expert reviews.

- Vulnerability databases are also mostly about vulnerabilities first and software
  package second, making it difficult to find if and when a vulnerability applies
  to a piece of code. VulnerableCode focus is on software package first where
  a Package URL is a key and natural identifier for packages; this is making it
  easier to find a package and whether it is vulnerable.

Package URL themselves were designed first in ScanCode and VulnerableCode
and are now a de-facto standard for vulnerability management and package references.
See https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec

The VulnerableCode project is a FOSS community resource to help improve the
security of the open source software ecosystem and its users at large.

VulnerableCode consists of a database and the tools to collect, refine and keep
the database current.

   **Warning**

   VulnerableCode is under active development and is not yet fully
   usable.


Read more about VulnerableCode https://vulnerablecode.readthedocs.org/

VulnerableCode tech stack is Python, Django, PostgreSQL, nginx and Docker and
several libraries.


Getting started
===============

Run with Docker
---------------

First install docker, then run

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode.git && cd vulnerablecode
    make envfile
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d
    docker compose run vulnerablecode ./manage.py import --list

Then run an importer for nginx advisories (which is small)

.. code:: bash

    docker compose exec vulnerablecode ./manage.py import nginx_importer
    docker compose exec vulnerablecode ./manage.py improve --all

At this point, the VulnerableCode app and API should be up and running with
some data at http://localhost


Populate VulnerableCode database
--------------------------------

VulnerableCode data collection works in two steps: importing data from multiple
sources and then refining and improving how package and software vulnerabilities
are related.

To run all importers and improvers use this

.. code:: bash

   ./manage.py import --all

.. code:: bash

   ./manage.py improve --all


Local development installation
------------------------------

On a Debian system, use this

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install  python3-venv python3-dev postgresql libpq-dev build-essential
    git clone https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode.git && cd vulnerablecode
    make dev envfile postgres
    make test
    source venv/bin/activate
    ./manage.py import nginx_importer
    ./manage.py improve --all
    make run

At this point, the VulnerableCode app and API is up at http://127.0.0.1:8001/
