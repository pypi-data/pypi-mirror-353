# Advanced Agents Implementation Summary

## Overview

AgentiCraft v0.1.1 introduces two powerful specialized agents that extend the base Agent class with advanced capabilities:

1. **ReasoningAgent** - Transparent, step-by-step reasoning
2. **WorkflowAgent** - Multi-step workflow orchestration

Both agents are fully implemented, tested, and documented.

## ReasoningAgent

### Purpose
ReasoningAgent makes AI thinking transparent by exposing its step-by-step reasoning process. This is ideal for:
- Educational applications
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Building trust through transparency
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives

### Key Features

1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**
   - Automatically prompts for detailed thinking
   - Parses and structures reasoning steps
   - Provides both raw and formatted output

2. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
   - Analyze topics from multiple viewpoints
   - Configurable perspectives
   - Automatic synthesis of insights

3. **Reasoning History**
   - Tracks all reasoning sessions
   - Allows retrospective analysis
   - Explainable AI capabilities

### Implementation Details
- **Location**: `/agenticraft/agents/reasoning.py`
- **Lines of Code**: ~400
- **Test Coverage**: 15 test methods
- **Key Classes**:
  - `ReasoningAgent` - Main agent class
  - `ReasoningResponse` - Enhanced response with reasoning details
  - `ReasoningStepDetail` - Individual reasoning step
  - `AnalysisResponse` - Multi-perspective analysis results

### Example Usage

```python
from agenticraft.agents import ReasoningAgent

# Create a reasoning agent
tutor = ReasoningAgent(
    name="MathTutor",
    instructions="You are a patient math tutor."
)

# Get step-by-step solution
response = await tutor.think_and_act(
    "How do I solve 2x + 5 = 13?"
)

# Access reasoning steps
for step in response.reasoning_steps:
    print(f"{step.number}. {step.description}")
    if step.conclusion:
        print(f"   â†’ {step.conclusion}")

# Multi-perspective analysis
analysis = await tutor.analyze(
    "Should we implement this feature?",
    perspectives=["technical", "business", "user"]
)
```

## WorkflowAgent

### Purpose
WorkflowAgent orchestrates complex multi-step processes with dependencies, parallel execution, and conditional logic. Perfect for:
- Data processing pipelines
- Business process automation
- Task orchestration
- Complex workflows with branching logic

### Key Features

1. **Workflow Definition**
   - Declarative step definition
   - Dependency management
   - Parallel execution support

2. **Conditional Logic**
   - Steps can have conditions
   - Dynamic workflow paths
   - Context-based decisions

3. **Error Handling**
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Timeout support
   - Graceful failure handling

4. **Custom Handlers**
   - Register custom step handlers
   - Async and sync support
   - Full agent context access

### Implementation Details
- **Location**: `/agenticraft/agents/workflow.py`
- **Lines of Code**: ~600
- **Test Coverage**: 20 test methods
- **Key Classes**:
  - `WorkflowAgent` - Main agent class
  - `Workflow` - Workflow definition
  - `WorkflowStep` - Individual workflow step
  - `WorkflowResult` - Execution results
  - `StepStatus` - Step execution status enum

### Example Usage

```python
from agenticraft.agents import WorkflowAgent

# Create workflow agent
agent = WorkflowAgent(name="DataProcessor")

# Define workflow
workflow = agent.create_workflow("data_pipeline")

# Add steps with dependencies
workflow.add_step("fetch", "Fetch data from API")
workflow.add_step("validate", "Validate data", depends_on=["fetch"])
workflow.add_step("transform", "Transform data", depends_on=["validate"])
workflow.add_step("save", "Save to database", depends_on=["transform"])

# Execute workflow
result = await agent.execute_workflow(workflow)

# Check results
print(result.format_summary())
for step_name, step_result in result.step_results.items():
    print(f"{step_name}: {step_result.status}")
```

## Testing

Both agents have comprehensive test coverage:

### ReasoningAgent Tests (`test_reasoning_agent.py`)
- Initialization and configuration
- Step-by-step reasoning parsing
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Reasoning history tracking
- Response formatting

### WorkflowAgent Tests (`test_workflow_agent.py`)
- Workflow creation and validation
- Sequential execution
- Parallel execution
- Conditional steps
- Error handling and timeouts
- Custom handlers

## Examples

Created detailed example scripts:

1. **`reasoning_agent_example.py`**
   - Math tutoring with step-by-step solutions
   - Multi-perspective policy analysis
   - Code debugging with reasoning traces

2. **`workflow_agent_example.py`**
   - Data processing pipeline
   - Parallel content generation
   - Conditional approval workflow
   - Error handling demonstration

## Integration

Both agents integrate seamlessly with existing AgentiCraft features:

- **Provider Switching**: Works with all LLM providers
- **Tools**: Full tool support for enhanced capabilities
- **Memory**: Conversation and context preservation
- **Base Agent Features**: All standard agent capabilities

## Benefits

### ReasoningAgent Benefits
- **Transparency**: See exactly how the AI thinks
- **Education**: Perfect for teaching and learning
- **Trust**: Build confidence through explainability
- **Debugging**: Understand complex problem-solving

### WorkflowAgent Benefits
- **Automation**: Complex processes made simple
- **Efficiency**: Parallel execution saves time
- **Flexibility**: Conditional logic for dynamic workflows
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for v0.2.0:
