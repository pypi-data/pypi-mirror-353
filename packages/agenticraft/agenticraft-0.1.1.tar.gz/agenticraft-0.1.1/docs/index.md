## Why AgentiCraft?

Building AI agents should be as simple as writing Python. No complex abstractions, no graph theory, no 500-page documentation. Just clean, simple code that works.

    Get your first agent running faster than making coffee. [Start here â†’](quickstart.md)

## Core Principles



- **ðŸš€ Simple First**  
  If it's not simple, it's not in core. Every API designed for developer joy.

- **ðŸ§  Transparent Reasoning**  
  See how your agents think, not just what they output. No black boxes.

- **ðŸ”Œ MCP-Native**  
  First-class Model Context Protocol support. Use any MCP tool seamlessly.

- **ðŸ“ˆ Production Ready**  
  Built-in observability, templates, and best practices from day one.

## Quick Example

```python
from agenticraft import Agent, tool

@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {})

agent = Agent(
    name="MathAssistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful math assistant.",
    tools=[calculate]
)

response = agent.run("What's 42 * 17 + 238?")
print(response.content)
# Output: "Let me calculate that for you: 42 * 17 + 238 = 952"

# See the reasoning process
print(response.reasoning)
# Output: "I need to calculate the expression 42 * 17 + 238..."
```

## Features at a Glance

### ðŸŽ¯ Simple Agent Creation
```python
agent = Agent(name="assistant")
```
That's it. No configuration files, no complex setup.

### ðŸ§  Transparent Reasoning
```python
response = agent.run("Complex question")
print(response.reasoning)  # See the thought process
```

### ðŸ”§ Easy Tool Integration
```python
@tool
def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {param}"
    
agent = Agent(tools=[my_tool])
```

### ðŸ”„ Simple Workflows
```python
workflow = Workflow(name="pipeline")
workflow.add_steps([
    Step("research", agent=researcher),
    Step("write", agent=writer, depends_on=["research"])
])
```

### ðŸ“Š Built-in Observability
```python
from agenticraft import Telemetry

telemetry = Telemetry(export_to="http://localhost:4317")
agent = Agent(telemetry=telemetry)
```
