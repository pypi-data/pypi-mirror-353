# Log and View Python Based LLM Conversations

**LLM Logger** is a lightweight, local-first tool for inspecting and understanding how your application interacts with large language models like OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude.

It helps you:

* Log and inspect each model call with request/response metadata
* View differences between turns in a conversation
* Visualize tool calls, tool responses, and system prompts
* Compare prompt strategies and debug session behavior

Ideal for developers building agent workflows, chat interfaces, or prompt-based systems.

## üì¶ Installation

### üîπ Installation Options

#### Option 1: From PyPI (Recommended for most users)

Install the prebuilt package if you just want to use the tool:

```bash
pip install llm-logger
```

#### Option 2: Local Copy (For direct integration or customization)

Clone the repository and install:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/akhalsa/llm_debugger.git

# rebuild ui (optional)
cd llm_debugger/llm_logger/front_end
npm install
npx tsc

# Install from the local copy
pip install ./llm_debugger
```

**Note:** All installation methods include pre-compiled frontend files. No Node.js or frontend build steps are required for basic usage. The static files (HTML, CSS, JS) are packaged with the library, so the debugger UI works out of the box. 

Rebuilding using npm install and npx tsc are required to update the .js files in the static/ folder

### üî∏ Development Setup (Only for contributors)

If you want to modify the logger or UI code:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python ‚â• 3.8
   - Node.js & npm (only needed for UI development)

2. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhalsa/llm_debugger.git
   cd llm_debugger
   
   # Optional: Create a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Frontend Development (only if modifying the UI):**
   ```bash
   cd llm_logger/front_end
   npm install
   npx tsc
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Wrap Your OpenAI Client

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import openai
import os
from llm_logger import wrap_openai

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai_client = wrap_openai(
    openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key),
    logging_account_id="my_project"
)
```

Then use `openai_client` as normal:

```python
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}
    ]
)
```

This writes logs to `.llm_logger/logs/`.

---

### 2. Launch the Log Viewer

#### Option A: Stand Alone Service Launched From Terminal
This option is ideal for viewing logs from an application running on your local device

```bash
# Default port (8000)
llm_logger

# Or specify a custom port
llm_logger -p 8000
```

Then open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option B: As An Endpoint In Your Python Web Application

You can run the debugger UI alongside your application if you're using a python webapp

**Same Process (using FastAPI):**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn
from llm_logger.log_viewer import create_log_viewer_app
log_viewer_app = create_log_viewer_app(base_url="/debugger")

# Your main application
app = FastAPI()

# Mount the debugger UI at /debugger
app.mount("/debugger", log_viewer_app)

# Run your application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

**With Custom Base URL:**

If you need to specify a custom base URL (for example, when the debugger is mounted at a specific path or accessed through a reverse proxy), you can use the `create_app` function:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from llm_logger.server import create_app

# Your main application
app = FastAPI()

# Create debugger app with custom base URL
debugger_app = create_app(base_url="/debugger")  # or any other path where it's mounted

# Mount the debugger UI
app.mount("/debugger", debugger_app)
```

This ensures that all internal links and API calls in the debugger UI will use the correct base URL.

**Parallel Process (e.g., in Docker):**
In production or distributed development environments, it is recommended to run the llm_logger UI as a stand alone process. 
```bash
# Start your main application
uvicorn your_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 &

# Start the debugger UI on a different port
llm_logger -p 8000 &

# Wait for both processes
wait
```

#### Option C: Docker Environment

If you're using Docker, you can include the debugger UI in your Dockerfile without requiring Node.js:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy your application code
COPY . .

# Expose ports for both your app and the debugger
EXPOSE 5000 8000

# Start both services
CMD ["bash", "-c", "uvicorn your_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 & llm_logger -p 8000 & wait"]
```
