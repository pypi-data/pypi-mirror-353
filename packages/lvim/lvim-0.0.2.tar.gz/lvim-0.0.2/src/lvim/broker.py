class NvimBroker:
    """Nvim message "broker"

    This is a secondary Nvim API client that is connected by default when lvim
    is started. Instead of being exposed in the REPL as `vim` for interactive
    use, this one starts the RPC event loop, which establishes a persistent
    connection to the nvim server.

    With this connection, notifications can be sent back to the lvim client via
    nvim's rpcnotify method:
    aemiller@nvim://|â‡’ vim.fn.rpcnotify(0, "lvim_ping")
    1
    pong

    Or in nvim itself:
    :lua vim.fn.rpcnotify(0, "lvim_ping")

    0 will notify all connected RPC clients. When an NvimBroker receives one,
    it will look up the corresponding notification handler and execute it with
    any arguments provided. See the notifications module for more info.

    TODO: Add a lua client for interacting with the broker in nvim.

    Args:
        parent: NvimSession. A connected parent session to the nvim server, which
            will be cloned to create the broker session.
        debug: bool. Enable additional debug behavior and output.

    Public Attributes:
        channel_id: int. ID assigned to the broker session, which can be used as
            the first argument to rpcnotify() in order to specifically notify
            this broker instance.
        session: NvimSession. Broker nvim session.
