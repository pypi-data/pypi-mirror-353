    Creates a copy of an image corrected for the central cross defect of the detector.

        correction_factor (float): Factor of intensity of a pixel on the center cross compared to the
            bulk pixels. Should be calculated from one or more flatfield images.
        additional_pixels (int): Number of pixels to add in the gap. Should be provided by manufacturer.
            Common valueas are either 2 or 4. If correction_factor is greater than 2.0,
            the number of additional pixels should be greater than 2.
            2 pixels means 1 pixel is smeared to 2 (which adds one pixel on each side).
