Client Modules
==============

This module contains all clients used to fetch and process raw data from BUBT's website. 
There are two primary approaches for data extraction:

1. **API Clients** - For interacting with BUBT routine APIs
2. **Scraping Clients** - For extracting data from HTML and PDF sources in the website
