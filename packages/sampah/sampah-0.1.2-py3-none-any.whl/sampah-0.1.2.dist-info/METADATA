# 🧭 S.A.M.P.A.H.

**Spatial Annotation Mapping Platform for Alignment & Heading**  
*A general-purpose image annotation tool with support for directional labeling.*

---

## 📝 Overview

**S.A.M.P.A.H.** is a lightweight image labeling application built for annotating not just the presence of objects — but their **orientation**. It enables annotators to label an object's **heading direction** using an **8D compass-style system**, in addition to bounding boxes or segmentation.

Whether you're labeling vehicles, humans, animals, or other directional objects, **S.A.M.P.A.H.** provides an intuitive interface to mark both **position** and **direction** with precision.

---

## 🧭 8D Compass Annotation

S.A.M.P.A.H. introduces a novel directional labeling system based on **8 compass directions**:

```
          N
       NW   NE
     W    ●    E
       SW   SE
          S
```

Each object annotation can be tagged with one of the following directions:

- **N** (North) back B
- **NE** (Northeast) Back-Right BR
- **E** (East) right R
- **SE** (Southeast) front-right FR
- **S** (South) front F
- **SW** (Southwest) front-left FL
- **W** (West) left L
- **NW** (Northwest) back-left BL

This is ideal for tasks involving:
- **Object orientation** (e.g., which way a person or vehicle is facing)
- **Motion prediction**
- **Pose estimation (simplified)**

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 Label images with bounding boxes or masks
- 🧭 Add an 8-direction compass heading to each object
- 🧠 Supports class-based object labeling
- 💾 Saves annotations in **Pascal VOC** format (XML), with added direction tag
- 🌐 Simple Flask + HTML interface — run locally with no installation overhead

---

## 📂 Annotation Format

S.A.M.P.A.H. saves annotations in a modified **Pascal VOC XML** format, with an extra `<direction>` tag inside each object block:
```xml
<object>
    <name>front</name>
    <bndbox>
        <xmin>123</xmin>
        <ymin>85</ymin>
        <xmax>200</xmax>
        <ymax>160</ymax>
    </bndbox>
</object>
```
