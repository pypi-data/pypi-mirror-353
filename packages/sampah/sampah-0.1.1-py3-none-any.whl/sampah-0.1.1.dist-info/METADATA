🅰️ SAMPAH – Smart Annotation Management Platform for Adaptive Handling
✅ Why this works:

    Smart Annotation Management – core of your tool

    Platform – it's a web-based system

    Adaptive Handling – captures the idea of multidirection, flexibility, and extensibility

🔁 “Adaptive Handling” implies:

    multiple object types

    different labeling needs (bbox, polygons, classification)

    orientation, direction, or temporal change (like in video)
