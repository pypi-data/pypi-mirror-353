**Multi-Agent Accelerator for Data Science: Batch AutoML (MAADSBML)

*Revolutionizing Data Science with Artificial Intelligence*

**Overview**

*MAADSBML combines Artificial Intelligence, Docker, Machine Learning.  It automates the machine learning process, and finds the BEST algorithm for your data.  It also
produces a very detailed PDF report.  MAADSBML is integrated with Docker Container.
 
This library allows users to harness the power of agent-based computing using hundreds of advanced linear and non-linear algorithms.

**Compatibility**
    - Python 3.8 or greater
    - Minimal Python skills needed

**Copyright**
   - Author: Sebastian Maurice, PhD

**Installation**
   - At the command prompt write:
     **pip install maadsbml**
     - This assumes you have [Downloaded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and installed it on your computer.  
	 - You will also need to pull the MAADSBML Docker container:  **maadsdocker/maads-batch-automl-otics**

**Syntax**
  - There are literally two lines of code you need to write to train your data and make predictions:

**Main functions:**
   - **hypertraining**
     Executes hundreds of agents, running hundreds of advanced algorithms and completes in minutes.  A master agent then chooses the BEST algorithm that best  models your data.
   - **hyperpredictions**
     After training, make high quality predictions - takes less than half a second (about ~100 milliseconds). Users can also generate predictions using **non-python code** 
	 such as JAVA.  	 
   - **algodescription**
     Get detailed information on the optimal algorithm found during hypertraining
   - **abort**
     Abort the training process.
   - **rundemo**
     To run canned demo of the system to see how it works.
   - **finddistribution**
     Finds the best distribution for your continuous data
	 
**First import the Python library.**

*removeoutliers* : int, optional, 1 or 0

- If 1, then outliers will be removed from your data.  If 0, no outliers are removed.

*hasseasonality* : int, optional, 1 or 0
      
- If 1, then your data will be modeled for seasonality: Winter, Summer, Shoulder. If 0, then your data will 
  not be modeled for seasonality.  If modeling for seasonality, ensure you have enough data points that 
  covers the seasons, usually 1 year of data.
