eggstats is a simple program to rapidly analyze a fasta alignment and
perform diversity analysis. It can detect population labels from the
fasta file (in the form of ``@0``, ``@1``, ``@2`` labels. ``@999`` is
reserved for outgroup sequences. If different populations and/or
outgroups are present, additional statistics will be computed.

Once the program is installed, type ``eggstats`` to get a short manual
page.
