Implementation of Mersenne Twister algorithm (Random class)

    The algorithm and original C source code have been designed by M.

    Equidistributed Uniform Pseudo-Random Number Generator, ACM
    Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation, Vol. 8, No. 1.

    The generators returning floating point numbers are based on a
    version by Isaku Wada.

    The Mersenne Twister random number generator has been ported to C++
    by Jesper Bedaux.

    Copyright 2003 Jasper Bedaux

    Feedback about the C++ port should be sent to Jasper Bedaux,
    see http://www.bedaux.net/mtrand/ for e-mail address and info.

    The interface was revised and non-uniform random number generators
    have been included from the Random class of EggLib v2.1.3
