    *below* a branch (in the direction towards leaves). So the length
    describe in the instance concerns the branch *above* the
    corresponding node (towards the base of the tree). Branches 
    (connections between nodes) have a direction: they go *from* a node 
    *to* another node. Nodes have therefore *children*  and *parents* 
    (a given node have one parent except the base of the tree which has 
    none). Connecting a node to itself, making a two-way branch (to 
    branches connecting the same two nodes in opposite directions) or

    :param string: newick-formatted string representing the the tree to import.
        If it not allowed to specified both *fname* and *string*.

    The instance can be initialized as an empty tree (with only a root 
    node), or from a newick-formatted string. By default, the string is 
    read from the file name passed as the *fname* argument to the 
    constructor, but it can be passed directly through the constructor 
    argument *string*. It is not allowed to set both *fname* and 
    *string* at the same time. If neither is specified, an empty tree, 
    containing only a bare base node, is created. The newick parser 
    expects a well-formed newick string (including the trailing 
    semicolon).

    Nodes are implemented as :class:`.Node` instances.  A node without 
    children is a *leaf* and otherwise it is *internal*. A node with 
    exactly one child is generally meaningless, but is allowed. All 
    nodes (internal nodes as well as leaves) have a *label* which in 
    the case of leaves can be used as a sample name. It is not possible 
    to apply a name *and* a label to leaf node, in agreement with the 
    newick format. All connections between nodes (*branches*) are 
    oriented and can have a length (although the lengths can be 
    omitted) but note that labels are applied to nodes, not branches. 
    All :class:`!Tree` instances have one base node which is the only 
    one allowed not to have a parent. Network-like structures are not 
    allowed (because nodes must have exactly one parent).

    Import and export to/from strings and files are in the 
    bracket-based `newick  <http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html>`_ 
    format (the parser treats terminal node labels as strings, and 
    internal node labels as integers or, by default, floats). 
    :class:`!Tree` instances can be exported as a built-in :class:`str` 
    function by the syntax ``str(tree)`` or using the method 
    :meth:`~.Tree.newick`. Nodes also have a :meth:`~.Node.newick` 
    method.

    :class:`!Tree` instances are iterable. Three iterators are 
    provided: one is depth-first (:meth:`~.Tree.depth_iter`), another 
    is breath-first (:meth:`~.Tree.breadth_iter`) and one iterates on

            to its parent.

        *node* represents the branch that must be removed from the tree
        (this node is destroyed in the process). It must be one of the
        nodes contained in the tree (as a :class:`~.Node` instance), but
        not the base of the tree. It cannot be an terminal node (leaf). 

        If *ignore_label* is not set to ``True``, the label of the
        destroyed node is transferred to the parent based on the
        following procedure: (1) if the destroyed node's label is
        ``None``, nothing is done; (2) if the destroyed node's parent's
        label is ``None``, the destroyed node's label is copied to its
        parent as is; (3) otherwise both labels are converted to strings
        (if they are not yet) and concatenated as in the string ``a;b``
        (where ``a`` is the parent's label and ``b`` is the destroyed
        node's label), even if the two labels are identical.

        If *ignore_len* is not set to ``True``, and if the length of the
        removed branch (branch from the specified node to its parent) is
        specified, it will be spread equally among the branches to its
        children (see example below). This requires that the branch
        length to all children are specified. If the removed branch has
        no specified length, nothing is done.

        r"""
        Root or reoriente the tree. By default, a new node is created
        to represent the root and is placed on the branch leading to
        the provided outgroup node (the second argument determines where
        the new node is placed on this branch). Otherwise, the tree is
        reoriented such as its base is placed at the location of the
        provided outgroup. In the former case, its ends with a
        bifurcation at the root; in the latter case, a trifurcation.
        It is illegal to call this method on trees that are already
        rooted (have a difurcation at the root).

        :param outgroup: :class:`~.Node` instance contained in this
            tree. It can be a leaf or any internal node, but not the
            current base of the tree (unless *reoriente* is ``True``: in
            that case, it *might* be the base of the tree [it will not
            change anything] and it *cannot* be a leaf).

        :param branch_split: where to cut the branch leading to the
            outgroup.

        :param reoriente: don't create any root node *branch_site* is
            therefore not considered) and only place the node provided
            as *outgroup* at the base of the tree, thereby
            merely changing the representation of the tree.

        The information below describes the case where
        *reoriente* is ``False`` (proper rooting).

        If the branch to the provided outgroup doesn't have a branch
        length, the *branch_split* argument is ignored. Otherwise,
        *branch_split* must be a real number between 0 and 1 and give
        the proportion of the branch that must be allocated to the basal
        branch leading to the outgroup, the complement being allocated
        to the branch leading to the rest of the tree. If *branch_split*
        is either 0 or 1, one of the branch will have a length of 0, but
        it will exist anyway.

        If the original tree has this structure::

             /------------------------------------------->[1]
             |
             |             /----------------------------->[3]

        And rooting is requested at node ``[9]``, the root will be
        placed on the branch marked by ``[ROOT]``.  The outcome will be
        as depicted below, with the introduction of a new node (marked
        ``[ROOT]``) and the reorientation of the tree to place it at the
        base::

                                /-------------------------[1]
                                |
                         /-----[0]     /------------------[3]
                         |      |      |
                         |      \-----[2]      /----------[5]
                         |             |       |
             /---[E2]---[7]            \------[4]
             |           |                     |
             |           |                     \----------[6]
             |           |
           [ROOT]        \--------------------------------[8]

             \--------[E1]--------[9]
                                   |
                                   \---------------------[11]

        In this example, the relationship between nodes ``[7]`` and
        ``[0]`` (the previous base of the tree) is reverted. The label
        of node ``[7]`` is automatically transferred to node ``[0]``.
        This is consistent with the idea that internal node labels
        describe a property of the branch. The original label of the
        base, if it exists, is discarded. Since the branch between
        ``[7]`` and ``[9]`` is cut in two, the original label of node
        ``[9]`` is copied to node ``[7]``, leaving them both with the
        same label. However, if the outgroup is a terminal node, the
        label is not copied and the other basal branch is left without
        label.

        Let :math:`L` be the length of the branch from ``[7]`` and ``[9]``
        in the original tree, and :math:`r` the value of the parameter
        *branch_split*. The length of the branch ``[E1]`` will be set
        to :math:`rL`, and the branch ``[E2]`` to :math:`(1-r)L`. Overall, the
        length of the tree will not be modified.

        In the case that *reoriente* is ``True``, the final tree is rather::

            /------------------------------------------->[10]
            |
            |------------------------------------------->[11]
            |
           [9]       /----------------------------------->[8]
            |        |
            \------>[7]       /-------------------------->[1]
                     |        |
                     \------>[0]      /------------------>[3]
                              |       |
                              \----->[2]        /-------->[5]
                                      |         |
                                      \------->[4]
                                                |
                                                \-------->[6]

        The topology of the tree is the same as the initial one, except
        that the base is now ``[9]``. The lengths of all branches are
        conserved. However, node labels between the old and the new base
        are reverted: the node label of the new base (``[9]`` in the
        example) is affected to the next node (``[7]`` in the example)
        and so on until the old base (``[0]`` in the example), whose
        label, if it exists, is discarded.

        its label if it exists) and to set the length of the branch
        from ``[0]`` to ``[2]`` to the sum of the ``[0]`` to ``[1]`` and
        ``[1]`` to ``[2]``. But, with *keep_parent* is ``True``,
        the tree is left as is.

        There is a special case with the base of the tree. Assume that
        we remove node ``[1]`` from the original tree above. We then
        would have a non-standard structure with a single child to the
        base of the tree::

                                /--------------------------->[7]
                                | 
                [0]----------->[6]            /------------->[9]
                                |             |
                                \----------->[8]
                                              |
                                              \------------>[10]

        In that case, the base is not removed, but node ``[6]`` is
        removed using the :meth:`~.Tree.collapse` method (using option
        *ignore_len* set to ``False`` but *ignore_label* set to ``True``
        since the base is not supposed to bear a label). We end up with
        the following structure::

                 /--------------------------------->[7]
                 | 
                [0]                  /------------->[9]
                 |                   |
                 \----------------->[8]
                                     |
                                     \------------>[10]

        The length of the branch from ``[0]`` to ``[6]`` is spread
        equally between the branch from ``[0]`` to ``[7]`` and the
        branch from ``[0]`` to ``[8]`` (and so on if there are actually
        more than one descendants). If *keep_parent* is ``True`` or if
        ``[6]`` is a terminal node, it is not removed.
