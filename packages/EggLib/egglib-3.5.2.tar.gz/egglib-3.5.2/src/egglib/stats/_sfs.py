    Compute the site frequency spectrum. This function processes an
    list of sites (or any iterator yielding :class:`.Site` instances)
    and computes the distribution of frequencies of either the minority
    or the derived allele of diallelic sites.

    :param sites: an iterator over :class:`.Site` instances. Unless
        *nbins* is specified, all sites are required to have the same
        number of samples.
    :param struct: a :class:`.Structure` instance defining the samples
        to process and/or the outgroup samples (necessary for the 
        unfolded spectrum).
    :param max_missing: maximum relative proportion of missing data in 
        the ingroup to process a site. Warning: when using this option
        without binarization (absolute frequencies), the results might
        be unreliable as sites with missing data have less samples.
    :param mode: indicate whether the SFS should be folded or unfolded
        (possible only when outgroup is present in struct). ``auto``: as
        implied by the outgroup; ``folded``: folded (even if there is an
        outgroup); ``unfolded``: unfolded (causing an error if no
        outgroup is present).
    :params nbins: number of bins on which to calculate the SFS. If
        ``None``, the full SFS is returned as a list.
    :params skip_fixed: boolean indicating whether fixed sites should be
        counted of not. If set to ``True`` with a full, folded SFS
        (``nbins=None`` with no outgroup used), the first and last count
        values are set to ``None`` but kept in the returned list.
    :return: If bins are specified: a list of ``(bound, count)`` tuples
        where *bound* is the top limit of each bin, which is inclusive,
        and *count* is the number of sites falling in this category.
        Otherwise (``nbins=None``): a list containing the absolute SFS,
        giving the number of sites corresponding to all possible
        frequencies ranging from 0 to ``n/2+1`` (if folded) or ``n-1``
        (unfolded), inclusive.
