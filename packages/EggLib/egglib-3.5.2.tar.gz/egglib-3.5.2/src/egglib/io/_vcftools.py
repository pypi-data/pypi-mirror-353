            Return an iterator over sites. Each variant found in the VCF
            file is returned as a :class:`.Site` instance.

            By default, process sites from the current position up to
            the end of the file. To control the region used for
            iteration, use the *chrom*, *start*, and *stop* argument.

            :param chrom: name of the chromosome to process. If *None*,
                process all chromosomes. By default (if *start* and
                *stop* are not specified) process the whole chromosome,
                going back to the first position if needed. Only
                available if the VCF is indexed.

            :param start: start position. Only allowed if *chrom* is
                specified. The first site returned will be at the
                smallest available position starting from *start*. By
                default, start at the beginning of the chromosome.

            :param stop: stop position. Only allowed if *chrom* is
                specified. The position of the last site returned will
                be a most the one before the *stop* position. By
                default, stop at the last site of the chromosome.

            :param max_missing: maximum number of missing data to
                consider a variant. By default, all sites with at least
                one missing data are ignored.

            :param mode: 0: include only SNP variants (variants with at
                least two alleles, all corresponding to a single
                nucleotide, although those alleles are not required to
                be called in genotypes); 1: include SNP variants and
                invariant positions; 2: include all variants from the 
                VCF. The default is 0.
