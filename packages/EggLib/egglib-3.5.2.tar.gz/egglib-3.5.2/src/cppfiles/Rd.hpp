    *   structure of the ingroup (the rest is ignored).
    * * Load as many sites as needed. They are analysed on the fly. The
    *   number of samples is expected to match (as well as the order of
    *   individuals and the phase if relevant). If there is a mismatch
    *   in number of samples, the Rd value will be UNDEF.
    * * Compute the Rd value (resets the instance).
