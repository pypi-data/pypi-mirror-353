   /** \brief Specifically designed to compute Innan 2003 statistics for a gene family
    * 
    * \ingroup diversity
    *
    * This class computes the within- and between-paralog Pi of Innan
    * (2003). The within-paralog Pi is the same as the standard Pi,
    * except that it is not unbiased. The between-paralog Pi is the same
    * as Dxy, taking the paralogs as populations, except that one pair
    * of genes (paralogs from the same sample) is not considered.
    *
    * Setup provides the two structure objects describing respectively
    * the structure in paralogs and the structure in samples (two
    * different structure objects are required because they are necessarily
    * non-nested). It is required that the structures of interest are
    * loaded as population levels. Cluster levels are ignored. The
    * maximum index of the paralog structure must be represented in all
    * sites (other disagrements are treated as missing data). Both
    * structure objects must have a ploidy of 1.
