    *
    * \ingroup parsers
    *
    * Read fasta-formatted sequence data from a file specified by name
    * or from an open stream. See the description of the format below.
    *
    *    - Each sequence is preceded by a header limited to a single
    *      line and starting by a ">" character.
    *
    *    - The header length is not limited and all characters are
    *      allowed but white spaces and special characters are
    *      discouraged. The header is terminated by a newline character.
    *
    *    - Group labels are specified a special markup system placed at
    *      the end of the header line.
    *
    *    - Group labels are ignored unless specifically specified in a
    *      parser's options.
    *
    *    - The sequence itself continues on following lines until the
    *      next ">" character or the end of the file.
    *
    *    - White spaces, tab and carriage returns are allowed at any
    *      position. They are ignored unless for terminating the header
    *      line. There is no limitation in length and different
    *      sequences can have different lengths.
    *
    *    - Characters case is preserved and imported. Note that, when
    *      *groups* is true and that sequences are placed in a
    *      DataHolder instance, their position in the original fasta
    *      file is lost. Exporting to fasta will automatically place
    *      them at the end of the file.
