   /** \brief Classify alleles and site for frequencies with several populations
    *
    * \ingroup diversity
    *
    * Statistics:
    *   Sp  -- population-specific alleles
    *   Spd  -- population-specific derived alleles
    *   ShP -- number of alleles segregating in at least one pair of populations
    *   ShA -- number of alleles in non-null frequencies in at least one pair of populations
    *   FxA -- number of alleles fixed in at least one population
    *   FxD -- number of fixed differences (two different alleles fixed in a pair of populations)
    *
    * The user must ensure that all passed sites are polymorphic. The user
    * should also probably exclude populations with low sample sizes if they
    * are interested in the number of fixed alleles (populations with no
    * samples are automatically skipped).
    *
    * The statistics are computed for each site. Sums for multi-sites
    * are available as Sp_T and Sp_T1 (and similarly for other statistics).
    * T1 is such as each site is counted only once for any statistic.
    *
