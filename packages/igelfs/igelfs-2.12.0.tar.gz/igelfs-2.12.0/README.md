Python implementation of the IGEL filesystem.

## Description

`igelfs` provides various data models and methods to interact with an IGEL filesystem image.

`igelfs.models` contains several dataclasses to represent data structures within the filesystem.

Generally, for handling reading from a file/device, use `igelfs.Filesystem`,
which provides methods to obtain sections and access the data structures within them,
in an object-oriented way.
`Filesystem` also provides simple methods to write bytes/sections.

A command-line interface is also provided for common filesystem operations.
