## Project Overview

This repository is a simple showcase Python package demonstrating how to use [dlt](https://dlthub.com/) for data extraction and loading. The package is structured to extract data from sources and load it into parquet, DuckDB and etc, serving as a reference for integrating dlt in your own projects.

## Getting Started

### Clone and run 
import package from pypi or clone and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-espootin/poc_dlthub
cd poc_dlthub
make run
```



The main dlt pipeline file is located at:

```
src/app/ingest/
```
- ignore : src\app\utils

Refer to this path when running or modifying the pipeline.
