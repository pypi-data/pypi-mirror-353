    their capability to perform challenging tasks, potential to speed up the adoption
    of AI, ability to increase productivity and the cost benefits they provide. Discuss
    the three categories of risk, including risks known from earlier forms of AI,
    known risks amplified by foundation models and emerging risks intrinsic to the
    generative capabilities of foundation models. Cover the principles, pillars and
    governance that form the foundation of IBM’s AI ethics initiatives and suggest

  name: Exposing personal information
  description: When personal identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal
    information (SPI) are used in training data, fine-tuning data, or as part of the
    prompt, models might reveal that data in the generated output. Revealing personal
    information is a type of data leakage.

  descriptor: amplified
  concern: 'Improper data curation can adversely affect how a model is trained, resulting
    in a model that does not behave in accordance with the intended values. Correcting
    problems after the model is trained and deployed might be insufficient for guaranteeing
    proper behavior. '
