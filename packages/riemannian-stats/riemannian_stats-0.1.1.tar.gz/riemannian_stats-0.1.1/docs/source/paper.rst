Riemannian Principal Component Analysis
---------------------------------------

**R-PCA** is a novel extension of Principal Component Analysis designed to operate on datasets that reside on
non-Euclidean spaces. Instead of assuming a flat Euclidean structure, R-PCA leverages local geometric information,
derived via the **UMAP** algorithm, to define a **Riemannian manifold** over the data. This allows for more accurate
dimensionality reduction and statistical analysis that respects the intrinsic structure of complex datasets.

**Applications include**:

- High-dimensional structured data
- Clustering with geometric consistency
- Real-world datasets such as image sets (e.g., Olivetti Faces)

R-PCA improves interpretability, variance capture, and clustering performance compared to standard
PCA especially in cases where local metrics vary significantly across the dataset.
