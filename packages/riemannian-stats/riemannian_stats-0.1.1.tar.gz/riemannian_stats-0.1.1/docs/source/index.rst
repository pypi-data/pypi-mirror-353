Riemannian STATS
================

**Riemannian STATS: Statistical Analysis on Riemannian Manifolds**

**Riemannian STATS** is a Python package designed to extend classical multivariate statistical methods to data that lie on non-Euclidean spaces. This package introduces a general framework for **Riemannian Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA)**, a method developed to operate on datasets modeled as **Riemannian manifolds**. The foundational ideas are presented in the scientific paper `"Riemannian Principal Component Analysis"` by Oldemar Rodríguez.

Unlike traditional PCA, which assumes a flat Euclidean geometry, R-PCA uses **UMAP** to define local distances and induce a Riemannian structure from any data table—structured or unstructured, real or synthetic. This enables geometric-aware dimensionality reduction and correlation analysis, even on datasets with complex topologies, non-linear relationships, or varying local densities.

Built on these principles, **Riemannian STATS** enables:

- Transformation of data tables into Riemannian manifolds via UMAP-based metrics.
- Riemannian correlation and covariance computation.
- Extraction of Riemannian principal components.
- Intuitive 2D/3D visualizations reflecting the manifold’s geometry.
- Applications in high-dimensional data, image analysis, clustering, and beyond.

The core idea is simple yet powerful: **treat your dataset not as flat, but as curved**—honoring its internal structure. This unlocks more expressive models, better visualizations, and more accurate statistical summaries.

**Ideal for** researchers, data scientists, and developers looking to enhance their analysis of complex datasets with geometry-aware tools.
