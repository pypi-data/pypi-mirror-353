# Debug Mode Toggle Feature

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a debug mode toggle functionality in the AI-SDLC system. The feature will allow users to switch between standard code generation mode and a specialized debug mode that utilizes a 3-step prompt chain for systematic incident diagnosis, solution architecture, and remediation execution.

## Problem statement

Currently, the AI-SDLC system operates in a single mode focused on standard development workflows. When users encounter complex issues, bugs, or system failures, they lack a structured debugging workflow that can systematically diagnose problems, architect solutions, and execute remediation steps. This results in ad-hoc debugging approaches that may miss root causes or implement incomplete solutions.

## Goals and objectives

### Primary goals

- Implement a toggle mechanism allowing users to switch between code mode and debug mode
- Provide a structured 3-step debugging workflow for systematic issue resolution
- Enable seamless data flow between debug steps using XML tag integration
- Maintain tool-agnostic design principles consistent with AI-SDLC architecture

### Secondary goals

- Improve debugging efficiency through structured workflows
- Reduce time-to-resolution for complex technical issues
- Provide comprehensive documentation and audit trails for debugging sessions
- Enable reusable debugging patterns and templates

## Success metrics

### Quantitative metrics

- Debug mode adoption rate: >30% of users utilize debug mode within 30 days of release
- Issue resolution time: 25% reduction in average time-to-resolution for complex issues
- Debug session completion rate: >80% of debug sessions complete all 3 steps
- User satisfaction score: >4.0/5.0 for debug mode functionality

### Qualitative metrics

- User feedback indicates improved debugging experience
- Reduced escalation of complex technical issues
- Increased confidence in systematic problem-solving approaches
