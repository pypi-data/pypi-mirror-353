Annotation:

The MIT License, established by the MIT in the late 1980s, is a permissive software license designed to facilitate free use, modification, sharing, and commercialization of software. Its primary goal is to foster collaboration and innovation by minimizing barriers to code reuse while ensuring proper attribution to authors and creators through the inclusion of the original copyright notice and license in any redistributions.

Distribution means delivering software or part of it to end-users via various means, including physical media, online platforms, cloud services, app stores and virtual environments.

If you develop a product that diverges from the original purpose of this software (e.g., a mobile app, SaaS platform, or custom software for monetization), you MUST only acknowledge the original author(s) by mentioning the software's name at the end of your legal documents (e.g., privacy policy, terms of service), in a dedicated section such as "About", "Appreciations" or "Acknowledgments," or in other placements such as the website footer or a statement like: "We are grateful to the communities behind these open-source projects on which we depend: [list software names or link to a dedicated page with this list]." Optionally, include the author(s) and a link to the public repository for full license details. You do not have to disclose anything further or make your code public.

Conversely, if you fork or create public derivative works based on the original software, you MUST retain the MIT License and include it along with the original copyright notice and this annotation.
