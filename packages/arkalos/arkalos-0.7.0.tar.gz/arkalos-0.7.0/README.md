## Database & Data Warehouse Migrations

```python
class Migration(DatabaseMigration):
    
    def up(self):

        with DB().createTable('users') as table:
            table.col('id').id()
            table.col('name').string(64).notNull()
            table.col('email').string().notNull()
            table.col('is_admin').boolean().notNull().default('FALSE')
            table.col('created_at').datetime().notNull().defaultNow()
            table.col('updated_at').datetime().notNull().defaultNow()
            table.indexUnique('email')



    def down(self):
        DB().dropTable('users')
```



## Free Built-In Data Warehouse and Integrations

Data warehouses are centralized repositories that connect multiple data sources to enable AI and analytics.

Not every case needs complex and expensive tools like Snowflake or BigQuery. With Arkalos, you get a simple, local data warehouse right out of the box!

Arkalos connects seamlessly to popular tools like Notion, Airtable, Google Drive, and HubSpot.

Automatically detects and generates the schema.

And syncs data into your own data warehouse.

config/data_sources.py

```python
    'airtable': {
        'enabled': True,
        'api_key': env('AIRTABLE_API_KEY'),
        'base_id': env('AIRTABLE_BASE_ID'),
        'tables': env('AIRTABLE_TABLES'),
    }
```

SQLite is used as the default local data warehouse.

.env

```ini
DWH_ENGINE=SQLite
DWH_SCHEMA_PATH=data/dwh/schema.sql
DWH_SQLITE_PATH=data/dwh/dwh.db
```

```bash
uv run arkalos dwh sync
```

scripts/etl/my_script.py

```python
from arkalos.data.extractors.airtable_extractor import AirtableExtractor
# or for Notion
# from arkalos.data.extractors.notion_extractor import NotionExtractor
from arkalos.workflows.etl_workflow import ETLWorkflow

wf = ETLWorkflow(AirtableExtractor)
wf.run(drop_tables=True)
```

And that's it! Your data is imported automatically, ready for analysis or AI pipelines, and even accessible offline.

## Built-in HTTP API Server - Launch a Python Data or AI Microservice

Python is the world's fastest-growing programming language thanks to its rich ecosystem of data, AI, and scientific libraries.

Arkalos lets freelancers, consultants, startups, businesses, and even governments add powerful data and AI capabilities to their products and platforms. Simply launch Arkalos as a microservice and integrate it seamlessly into your architecture.

```bash
uv run arkalos serve

    DESCRIPTION = 'An Agent that understands the intent, determines which task to perform and runs it.'

    GREETING = 'Hi, I am a MultiAgent. I can tell your IP address, do basic math calculations or transform text to SQL.'
  
    ACTIONS = [
        WhatIsMyIpAction, 
        CalcAction, 
        TextToSQLAction
    ]

    def processMessage(self, message):
        response = f"Determining the intent and which task to run...\n"
        which_action = self.whichAction(message)
        response += f"Based on your question, I determined this task: {which_action}\n"
        response += f"Running this task...\n"
        output = self.runAction(which_action, message)

## Powerful Google Extractor

### Search and List Google Drive Files, Spreadsheets and Forms

```python
import polars as pl

from arkalos.utils import MimeType
from arkalos.data.extractors import GoogleExtractor

google = GoogleExtractor()

folder_id = 'folder_id'

# List files and their metadata in a Google Drive folder
files = google.drive.listFiles(folder_id)

# Search for files with regex and by type
files = google.drive.listFiles(folder_id, name_pattern='report', file_types=[MimeType.DOC_PDF])

print(pl.DataFrame(files))
```

### List All the Spreadsheets Recursively With Their Tabs (Sheets) Info

```python
files = google.drive.listSpreadsheets(folder_id, name_pattern='report', recursive_depth=1, with_meta=True, do_print=True)

for file in files:
    google.drive.downloadFile(file['id'], do_print=True)
```

### Download, Export Files and Spreadsheets or Google Form Responses

```python
google.drive.getFormMetadata(form_id)

google.drive.getFormResponses(form_id)

google.drive.getFormQuestions(form_id)

# Export Google Form responses as CSV
google.drive.downloadFile(form_id)

# Export Google Spreadsheet as LibreOffice Calc
google.drive.downloadFile(spreadsheet_id, 'my_folder/spreadsheet_name', as_mime_type=MimeType.SHEET_LIBRE_CALC)
```

### Get Data from Google Analytics 4

```python
# Past 28 days (minus 2 days of delay)
start_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=29)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
end_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

props = google.analytics.listProperties()

property_id = 'property_id'

google.analytics.fetchPages(property_id, start_date, end_date)

google.analytics.fetchTrafficStats(property_id, start_date, end_date)

google.analytics.fetchInternalSiteSearch(property_id, start_date, end_date)
```

### And From Google Search Console (GSC)

```python
google.analytics.listGSCSites()

site = 'sc-domain:arkalos.com'

google.analytics.fetchTopGSCPages(site, start_date, end_date)

queries = google.analytics.fetchTopGSCQueries(site, start_date, end_date)

# Sort by a built-in CTR Opportunity Score
pl.Config(tbl_rows=100)
pl.DataFrame(queries).select(pl.exclude('site', 'page_url', 'page_path')).sort('ctr_os', descending=True)

# Fetch top pages first and then their top queries (Page-first)
google.analytics.fetchTopGSCPagesThenQueries(site, start_date, end_date)

# Query-first
google.analytics.fetchTopGSCQueriesThenPages(site, start_date, end_date)

# Or as sections, instead of a single table
