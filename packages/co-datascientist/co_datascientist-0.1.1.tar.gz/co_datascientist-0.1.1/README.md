An agentic framework for recursive model improvement.

## 🚀 Quickstart
Install `co-datascientist`:

```bash
pip install co-datascientist
```

To use from command line, run:
```bash
co-datascientist run --script-path myscript.py
```

To use from cursor or other AI clients, run the MCP server:
```bash
co-datascientist mcp-server
```

And add the MCP configuration to the AI client. For example in cursor go to:
`file -> preferences -> cursor settings -> MCP -> Add new global MCP server`,
and add the co-datascientist mcp server config in the json, should look like this:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CoDatascientist": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
## 🧠 How does it work?
AI agents are advanced enough to hypothetize ideas, write the code, and evaluate results. 

While they're not yet advanced enough to do all of this independently, they are good enough to give a *worthy attempt* at each step.

CoDatascientist coordinates AI agents and automates the workflow of
Idea generation → implementation → testing.

The cycle is done iteratively, selecting the best candidates using the agent's own logic - this is why the metric for success has to be simple, which is the case with ML tasks: it's easy to boil the success to a single number or a vector.
