    \brief A local graph backed by an adjacency list file on disk.

    The graph is loaded into memory in a local way only. That is, an adjacency

    If a node is not found in the cached adjacency list, then the neighbours of
    the node are queried from the adjacency list on disk. This allows for local
    algorithms to be executed on very large graphs stored on disk without
    loading the whole graph into memory.

    See [Graph File Formats](@ref file-formats) for more information about the
    adjacency list file format.

    \note
    It is important that the adjacency list on disk is stored with sorted node
    indices. This allows us to query the neighbours of a given node in
    \f$O(\mathrm{log}(n))\f$ time using binary search.
