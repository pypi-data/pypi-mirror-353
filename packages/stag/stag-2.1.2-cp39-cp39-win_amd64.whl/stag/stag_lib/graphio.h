   * Load a graph from an edgelist file.
   *
   * We define an edgelist file in the following way.
   *   - Any lines beginning with '#' or '//' are ignored
   *   - Any blank lines are ignored
   *   - All other lines are of one of the formats
   *       - `<u>, <v>, <weight>`
   *       - `<u>, <v>`
   *       - `<u> <v> <weight>`
   *       - `<u> <v>`
   *
   *     where `<u>` and `<v>` can be parsed as integers, and `<weight>` can be parsed
   *     as a double. If the weight is omitted, it is taken to be 1.
   *
   * Here is an example edgelist file.
   *
   *     # This line is ignored
   *     0, 1, 0.5
   *     1, 2, 1
   *     2, 0, 0.5
   *
   * @param filename the name of the edgelist file to be loaded
   * @return stag::Graph object
   * @throws std::runtime_error if the file doesn't exist or cannot be parsed as an edgelist

  /**
   * Load a graph from an adjacencylist file.
   *
   * The adjacency list file format is defined in the following way.
   *   - Any lines beginning with `#` or `//` are ignored
   *   - Any blank lines are ignored
   *   - All other lines have the format `<node_id>: <list of neighbours>`, where
   *     `<node_id>` is an integer and `<list of neighbours>` is either a
   *     space-separated list of integers or a space-separated list of
   *     `<id>:<weight>` where `<id>` gives the id of the neighbour and
   *     `<weight>` is the weight of the edge.
   *   - The `<node IDs>` of each line must be sorted in increasing order.
   *   - The graph should have no self-loops.
   *
   * Here is an example adjacencylist file.
   *
   *     # This line is ignored
   *     0: 1 2
   *     1: 0 2 3
   *     2: 0 1
   *     3: 1
   *
   * The following example includes weighted edges.
   *
   *     # This line is ignored
   *     0: 1:0.5 2:0.5
   *     1: 0:0.5 2:1
   *     2: 0:0.5 1:1
   *
   * Note that this method loads the entire graph into memory. For large graphs,
   * the stag::AdjacencyListLocalGraph object can be used to access the graph
   * in a 'local' way without reading the entire graph into memory.
   *
   * @param filename the name of the adjacency list file to be loaded
   * @return stag::Graph object
   * @throws std::runtime_error if the file doesn't exist or cannot be parsed as
