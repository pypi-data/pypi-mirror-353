        "answer": "daf-2 mutations show synergistic interactions with eat-2 (caloric restriction mimetic) and skn-1 (oxidative stress response) mutations, where the combined effects enhance lifespan extension beyond what would be expected from adding individual effects.",

        "question": "Which genetic interventions show the largest positive effects on lifespan in C. elegans?",
        "answer": "In C. elegans, daf-2 mutations show the largest positive effect with 85.2% lifespan increase, followed by skn-1 mutations with 45.8% increase, and eat-2 mutations with 25.6% increase.",

        "question": "What types of synergistic interactions are found between longevity interventions?",
        "answer": "The database contains several types of interactions: synergistic enhancement (positive synergy where combined effects exceed individual effects), antagonistic interactions (where one intervention suppresses another), epistatic interactions (dependency relationships), and additive effects across species.",

        "answer": "Insulin signaling interventions show conserved longevity effects across species: daf-2 in C. elegans (85.2% increase), InR knockout in Drosophila (45.3% increase), and IGF1R heterozygous knockout in mice (18.9% increase), suggesting this pathway is evolutionarily conserved for longevity.",

        "question": "Which interventions show negative effects on lifespan and why?",
        "answer": "Several interventions show negative lifespan effects: daf-16 mutations (-15.7% effect) because they disrupt the FOXO transcription factor essential for longevity, sir-2.1 knockout (-22.3%) due to loss of sirtuin function, and age-1 mutations (-45.2%) from disrupting the PI3K pathway.",
