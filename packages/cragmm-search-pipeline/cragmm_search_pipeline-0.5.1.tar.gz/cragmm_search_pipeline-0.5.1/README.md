# CRAG-MM Search APIs

CRAG-MM is a visual question-answering benchmark that focuses on factuality of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It offers a unique collection of image and question-answering sets to enable comprehensive assessment of wearable devices.

## CRAG-MM Search API Description

The CRAG-MM Search API is a Python library that provides a unified interface for searching images and text. It supports both image and text queries, and can be used to retrieve relevant information from a given set of retrieved contents.

The *image search* API uses CLIP embeddings to encode the images. It takes an image or an image url as input and returns a list of similar images with the relevant information about the entities contained in the image. Similarity is determined by cosine similarity of the embeddings. See *Search for images* below for an example.

The *web search* API uses chromadb full text search to build an index for pre-fetched web search results. It takes a text query as input, and returns relevant webpage urls and meta data such as page title and page snippets. You can download the webpage content based on the urls and use the information to build Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Here, relevancy of the webpages are calculated based on cosine similarity. See *Search for text queries* below for an example.

Main class - `search.py`, contains UnifiedSearch class to handle image and text search.

demo - `python demo.py`


## Installation

```bash
pip install cragmm-search-pipeline==0.5.0
```

## Usage
### Task 1
```python
from cragmm_search.search import UnifiedSearchPipeline

# initiate image search API only
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-public-test-v0.1.2",
)
```


### Task 2

```python
from cragmm_search.search import UnifiedSearchPipeline

# initiate both image and web search API
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-public-test-v0.1.2",
    text_model_name="BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5",
    web_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/web-search-index-public-test-v0.1.2",
)
```

### Task 2 - private / interal evaluator

```python
from cragmm_search.search import UnifiedSearchPipeline

# initiate both image and web search API
search_pipeline = UnifiedSearchPipeline(
    image_model_name="openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336",
    image_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/image-search-index-private-test-v0.1.2",
    text_model_name="BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5",
    web_hf_dataset_id="crag-mm-2025/web-search-index-private-test-v0.1.2",
    web_hf_dataset_id_private="crag-mm-2025/web-search-contents-db-private-v0.1.2",
)
# result keys: ['index', 'score', 'page_name', 'page_url', 'page_snippet', 'page_result', 'page_last_modified', 'search_result_type']
```

### Get all image urls in the index
```python
img_urls = search_pipeline._get_all_image_urls()
# returns a list of unique image urls
```

### Search for images

```python
# Search the pipeline with an image
image_path = "data/image_sample.jpg"
print(f"Searching for: '{image_path}'")
results = search_pipeline(image_path, k=2)
print("Image search results:")
assert results is not None, "No results found"
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Search for text queries

```python
# Search the pipeline with a text query
text_query = "how long are the leaves of Tradescantia Zebrina?"
print(f"Searching for: '{text_query}'")
results = search_pipeline(text_query, k=3)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

The structure of the flower—usually ...Tradescantia zebrina has attractive zebra-patterned leaves, the upper surface showing purple new growth and green older growth parallel to the central axis, as well as two broad silver-colored stripes on the outer edges, with the lower leaf surface presenting a deep uniform magenta. The leaves are bluish green and usually have two longitudinal stripes that are silvery on the surface and purple on the underside. The stalked, parallel-veined leaves are mostly ovate, 4 to 10 cm long and 1.5 to 3 cm wide, pointed towards the tip, rounded to the base. The upper surface is glabrous to mildly hairy, the underside hairless to averagely hairy, ciliate towards the leaf base. The structure of the flower—usually from the three pink petals and the white sexual organs—is similar to that of the other Tradescantia, but unlike what happens in those, the plant branches off thanks to new buds whose attachment starts below that of the leaf (and not above). The three only grown at the base petals are ovate-blunt, pink to purple and 5 to 9 mm long. The six equally sized stamens are violet hairy. Three carpels have become a top permanent ovary grown. They form capsule fruits that contain gray-brown seeds. Skin irritation may result from repeated contact with or prolonged handling of the plant—particularly from the clear, watery sap (a characteristic unique to T. zebrina as compared with the other aforementioned types). Tradescantia zebrina is native to Mexico, Central America, and Colombia, but can also be found on the Caribbean islands. It is classified as a Category 1b Invasive Species in South Africa, and thus may no longer be planted or propagated. All trade in seeds, cuttings or other propagative material is prohibited. It may not be transported or be allowed to disperse, either in rural or urban areas. It is also an invasive species in the Galápagos Islands. Tradescantia zebrina var. Tradescantia zebrina, formerly known as Zebrina pendula, is a species of creeping plant in the Tradescantia genus. Common names include silver inch plant and wandering Jew. The latter name is controversial, and some now use the alternative wandering dude. The plant is popular in cultivation due to its fast growth and attractive foliage.',
