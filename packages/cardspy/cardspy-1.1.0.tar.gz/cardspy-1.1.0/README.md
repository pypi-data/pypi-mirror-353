# cardspy

A Python library for modeling and manipulating playing cards, decks, suits, and ranks. Provides utilities for games, simulations, and card-based logic.

## Features
- Full 52-card deck modeling
- Card, Suit, and Rank objects with rich properties
- Deck operations: shuffle, deal, add/remove cards, reset, clear
- Bitmask utilities for efficient card set operations
- 100% test coverage

## Installation
```bash
pip install cardspy
```

## Quick Start
```python
from cardspy.deck import Deck
from cardspy.card import Card, C2C, C3D, sort_cards, cards_mask, extract_cards, rank_mask_from_cards
from cardspy.suit import CLUB, DIAMOND, HEART, SPADE
from cardspy.rank import R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, RT, RJ, RQ, RK, RA

# Create a new deck
deck = Deck()
print(f"Deck has {deck.count()} cards")  # 52

# Shuffle and deal 5 cards
deck.shuffle()
cards_mask_val = deck.deal_cards(5)  # Bitmask of 5 cards
dealt_cards = extract_cards(cards_mask_val)
print("Dealt:", [str(card) for card in dealt_cards])

# Remove a card
deck.remove_card(C2C.key)
print(deck.contains(C2C.key))  # False

# Add a card back
deck.add_card(C2C.key)
print(deck.contains(C2C.key))  # True

# Sort cards
sorted_cards = sort_cards(dealt_cards)
print("Sorted:", [str(card) for card in sorted_cards])

# Bitmask utilities
mask = cards_mask([C2C, C3D])
print(mask)
print(extract_cards(mask))
print(rank_mask_from_cards(mask))
```

## API Reference

### Card
- `Card(key, rank, suit, code, name, symbol)`
- Predefined constants: `C2C`, `C2D`, ..., `CAS` (all 52 cards)
- Methods: `__str__()`, `__repr__()`

### Suit
- `Suit(key, code, name, symbol)`
- Predefined: `CLUB`, `DIAMOND`, `HEART`, `SPADE`

### Rank
- `Rank(key, code, name)`
- Predefined: `R2`, `R3`, ..., `RA`

### Deck
- `Deck()` — creates a new deck (full 52 cards)
- `deck.shuffle()` — shuffle deck
- `deck.clear()` — remove all cards
- `deck.reset()` — restore to full deck
- `deck.count()` — number of cards
- `deck.get_cards()` — list of `Card` objects in deck
- `deck.add_card(card_key)` — add a card by key
- `deck.add_cards(cards_key)` — add multiple cards by bitmask
- `deck.remove_card(card_key)` — remove a card by key
- `deck.remove_cards(cards_key)` — remove multiple cards by bitmask
- `deck.deal_cards(count, shuffle=True)` — deal N cards, returns bitmask
- `deck.deal_specific_card(card_key)` — deal a specific card
- `deck.deal_specific_cards(cards_key)` — deal specific cards by bitmask
- `deck.contains(card_key)` — check if card is present

### Utility Functions (in cardspy.card)
- `sort_cards(cards)` — sort by rank
- `cards_mask(cards)` — get bitmask from list of cards
- `extract_cards(mask)` — get list of cards from bitmask
- `extract_cards_key(mask)` — get list of card keys from bitmask
- `rank_mask_from_cards(mask)` — get rank bitmask from card bitmask

## Example: Poker Hand Evaluation
```python
from cardspy.card import C2C, C3C, C4C, C5C, C6C, cards_mask, extract_cards

# Create a straight flush
hand = [C2C, C3C, C4C, C5C, C6C]
mask = cards_mask(hand)
print("Hand mask:", mask)
print("Extracted:", extract_cards(mask))
```
