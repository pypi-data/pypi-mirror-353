    """
    A quantum state |psi> of a composite system A, B could be decomposed as |psi> = sum lambda_i |i_A> |i_B>,
    where lambda_i are non-negative real numbers, sum lambda_i^2 = 1, and |i_A>, |i_B> are orthonormal states.
    Such decomposition is called Schmidt decomposition, the lambda_i are called Schmidt coefficients,
    the number of non-zero lambda_i is called Schmidt number, and |i_A>, |i_B> are called Schmidt bases.

    In this function, we restrict A and B to be the first several qubits and the last several qubits respectively.

    Args:
        state_vector(np.ndarray): the state vector of the given state
        A_qubits(int): the number of the first qubits corresponding to A

    Returns:
        np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray: lambda_i, |i_A>, |i_B> respectively
