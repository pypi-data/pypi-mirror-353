"""
Program name: MockModel Testing Suite
Purpose description: This program conducts a series of unit tests on a mock deep learning model class,
                     designed to simulate basic functionality of a neural network using PyTorch.
                     Tests include model saving and loading, scoring methods (AUC, F1, Recall, Precision),
                     and the plotting of training progress metrics. The MockModel class is a stand-in for
                     complex model structures during testing of the BaseModel functionality.
Tests: The suite includes tests for file operations, scoring metrics validation, and visualization
       using synthetic data to ensure each method performs as expected.
Note: To execute these tests, PyTorch must be properly installed and configured. The testing framework
      used is 'unittest', a standard Python testing library.
