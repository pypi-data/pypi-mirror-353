# VishnuOperators

**VishnuOperators** is a simple Python package that provides basic arithmetic operations and Comparison Operators such as addition and Equal to . Itâ€™s designed for demonstration, educational purposes, and lightweight arithmetic and Comparision utilities.

## Features

-Arthimetric operators
-Comparision operatrors 
-Takes only two parameters as numbers as Input
-Easy-to-use function interface for the Arthimetric and Comparison operators

## Functions Present
Arthimetric operators
- Addition           -->add(a,b)
- Subration          -->sub(a,b)
- Multiplication     -->mul(a,b)
- Division           -->div(a,b)
- Modular Division   -->mod(a,b)
- Floor Division     -->flo(a,b)
- Exponentiate       -->exp(a,b)


Comparison operators
- Equal to                       -->equ(a,b)
- Not equal to                   -->neq(a,b)
- Greater than                   -->gre(a,b)
- Less than                      -->les(a,b)
- Greater than or equal to       -->geq(a,b)
- Less than or equal to          -->leq(a,b)

## Installation

```bash
pip install vishnuoperators


#Usage
from vishnuoperators import add, mul

print(add(5, 7))       # Output: 12
print(mul(3, 4))       # Output: 12
