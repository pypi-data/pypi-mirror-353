# clips2share

Clips2share helps you with the process of creating torrents for uploading adult clips to your favorite torrent tracker:

- extract all metadata from a user provided clips4sale link (title, description, tags, price, clip quality, and more)
- embed all these data using a template in the torrents metadata
- download header image from clips4sale and upload to an image hoster 
- create thumbnails from local clip using vcsi library and upload to image hoster 
- create the final torrent with torf lib and send it to qbittorrent 
- allows uploading to multiple trackers


## Installation

There are currently 4 different ways of running clips2share, based on the OS you are using:

| OS       | Binary | PyPI / PIP | Docker | source |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| Windows  | ❌     | ✅          | ✅     | ✅     |
| Mac OS X | ❌     | ✅          | ✅     | ✅     |
| Linux    | ✅     | ✅          | ✅     | ✅     | 

### Binary

Download, unpack and run the latest binary from the [release page](https://codeberg.org/c2s/clips2share/releases) and make sure that [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is installed in your PATH.

### PyPI / PIP

If python with PIP is already installed, just run `pip install clips2share` and make sure that [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is installed in your PATH.

### Docker

You can run clips2share without installing it locally using Docker:

```bash
docker run --pull always --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v /mypath/config:/config \
  -v /mypath/torrent:/torrent \
  noired4/clips2share:latest \
  --video "/torrent/Upload/video.mp4" \
  --url "https://www.example.com" \
  --delay-seconds 120
```
This runs the app in a temporary container, mounts your configuration and video folders, and passes the necessary arguments. The container will automatically remove itself when the task is complete.

#### Notes
- The '/config' volume should contain a config.toml file. You can use the example provided in the Configuration section.
- The '/data' volume should point to a directory containing the video file you want to upload.
- If you use qBittorrent with watch folders, ensure that the 'qbittorrent_watch_dir' path in config.toml is mapped inside '/data' so the generated .torrent file appears in the expected location inside the container.
- **Important:** Make sure that the path mappings used by your qBittorrent container match those used by clips2share. For example, if both containers access your host's '/home/user/data' as '/data', the paths will align correctly. If they don’t match, torrent files may reference incorrect locations, causing qBittorrent to fail seeding.
- **Also important:** The 'torrent_temp_dir' setting must point to a directory that exists inside a Docker-mounted volume. This ensures that the resulting .torrent file is accessible on your host system, allowing you to upload it to a tracker or inspect it if needed.


## Configuration

This is an example config.toml

```toml
[client.qbittorrent]
# Location where destination files are created
upload_directory = '/home/user/uploads/'

# Watch location where final torrents will be copied to for automatic seeding
# (If use_api is set to true, watch_directory will be ignored)
watch_directory = '/home/user/uploads/_autoadd/'

# API Settings
use_api = false
url = 'http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8080'
category = 'Upload'

# Wait either for user input or --delay-seconds [seconds] to delay seed after torrent creation to prevent announcing an unknown torrent to tracker
delayed_seed = true

[image_host.chevereto]
# Host and API Credentials of a chevereto image hosting instance used for uploading header and thumbnail images
host = 'hamster.is'
api_key = 'chv_your_api_key_check_your_user_settings_after_logging_in'

[torrent]
# Tags to decorate tracker uploads
static_tags = ['clips4sale.com']
# Location for torrents ready to be uploaded to a tracker
temporary_directory = '/home/user/temp/'
# If use_hardlinks set to true, torrent sources will use filesystem hardlinks instead of symlimks.
# This can prevent accidental deletion of files. Set this to false if source files come from other/remote filesystems.
use_hardlinks = true

# Tracker Sections
# Add one or more trackers here

[[trackers]]
name = 'opentrackr'
announce_url = 'udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce'
source_tag = 'opentrackr'
category = 'none'

[[trackers]]
name = 'empornium'
announce_url = 'http://tracker.empornium.sx:2710/YOURPASSKEY/announce'
source_tag = 'Emp'
category = 'Straight'
