This project is a python framework called `spearmint` that is published on PyPI. It is designed to be used as a library, and it is not intended to be run as a standalone application. The framework is built using Python 3.9 and above.

When asked to help build something, think step by step. Consider at least two approaches to the problem. If you are unsure about something, ask for clarification.

When writing code, use the following guidelines:
- Use `uv` to manage dependencies and run the application.
- Use `pytest` for testing.
- Use `black` for code formatting.
