Getting Started
===============

The [`pyfar workshop`](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyfar/gallery/main?labpath=docs/gallery/interactive/pyfar_introduction.ipynb) gives an overview of the most important pyfar functionality and is a good starting point. It is part of the [`pyfar example gallery`](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_gallery.html) that also contains more specific and in-depth examples that can be executed interactively without a local installation by clicking the mybinder.org button on the respective example. The [`pyrato documentation`](https://pyrato.readthedocs.io) gives a detailed and complete overview of pyrato. All these information are available from [`pyfar.org`](https://pyfar.org).


Installation
============

Use pip to install pyrato

    pip install pyrato

(Requires Python 3.9 or higher)

If the installation fails, please check out the [help section](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help).
