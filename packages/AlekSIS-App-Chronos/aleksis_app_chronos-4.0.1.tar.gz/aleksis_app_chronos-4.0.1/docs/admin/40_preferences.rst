System-wide settings for timetable and substitution display
===========================================================

The display of timetables and substitution plans can be customised
under *Admin → Configuration → Timetables*. The section contains the
following preferences:

* **Use parent groups in timetable views**: If a lesson or substitution
  has only one group and this group has parent groups, these groups will
  be shown.
* **Relevant days for substitution plans**: Substitution plans are only
  created for these days.
* **Time when substitution plans switch to next day**: At this time,
  the generated substitution plan will switch to the next day.
* **Number of days shown on substitutions print view**: Here you can set
  the number of days that will be shown on the substitutions print view
  (PDF file).
* **Show header box in substitution views**: The header box shows all
  affected/absent teachers/groups for the current day.
* **Show parent groups in header box in substitution views instead of original groups**:
  This setting determines the same setting as `Use parent groups in timetable views`,
  but for the printout.
* **Group types to show in timetables**: Only groups with these types will be shown
  in the timetable select.
* **Lesson calendar feed color**: Default color for lesson calendar feed.
* **Supervision calendar feed color**: Default color for supervision calendar feed.
* **Days of the week that appear in the timetable**: Only these days are shown
  in the timetable calendar.
