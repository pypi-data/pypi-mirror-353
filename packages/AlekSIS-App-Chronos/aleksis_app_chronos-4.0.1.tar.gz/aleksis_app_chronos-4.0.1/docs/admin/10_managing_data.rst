Managing timetable and substitution data
========================================

Creating timetables
-------------------

For interactively planning timetables using
time grids, please use AlekSIS-App-Lesrooster.

Alternatively, data can be imported from an external source.
The official distribution handbook contains documentation about
the existing integration apps.

Managing substitutions
----------------------

You can use *Timetables → Plan substitutions* to interactively
plan substitutions and cancellations for lessons affected by
absences. This consists of the following workflow:

1. Create absences of teachers at *Absences → Absences*
   (a link leading to this page is also including in the
   substitution planning frontend).
2. See all affected lessons at *Plan substitutions* and
   assign new teachers, subjects, and/or rooms. It is also
   possible to cancel the lesson. Students and teachers then
   can see the changed data and also will be notified, if activated.
