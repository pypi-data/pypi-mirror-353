Managing substitutions
======================

AlekSIS has two different ways for managing substitutions and cancellations.

Simple changing of lessons
--------------------------

For small changes, you can just open the timetable you want
to change a lesson in, select the lesson, and click the *Change* button.
The dialog then allows you to change the following data for a single lesson:

- Subject
- Teachers
- Rooms
- Cancellation
- Comment

Planing based on absences
-------------------------

Additionally, you can plan substitutions based on teacher absences.

The first step is creating absences of teachers at *Absences → Absences*
(a link leading to this page is also including in the substitution
planning frontend).

Then you can see all affected lessons at *Timetables → Plan substitutions* and
assign new teachers, subjects, and/or rooms. It is also possible to cancel the lesson.
Students and teachers then can see the changed data and also will be notified, if activated.

Especially helpful is the select for substitution teachers. It will show you
which teachers are available at the time and teach the same subject.
