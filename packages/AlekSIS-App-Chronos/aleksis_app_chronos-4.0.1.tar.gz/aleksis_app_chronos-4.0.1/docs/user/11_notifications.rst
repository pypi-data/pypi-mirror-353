Notifications about current changes
===================================

Users can get notifications about current changes to their personal timetables.
If the system administrator has enabled the feature, they are sent automatically.

The notifications are sent as standard AlekSIS notifications. In :ref:`core-notifications`,
you can find more information about the available channels and your configuration options.
