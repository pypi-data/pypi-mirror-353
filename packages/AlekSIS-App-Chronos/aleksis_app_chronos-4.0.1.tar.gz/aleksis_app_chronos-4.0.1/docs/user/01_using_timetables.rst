Finding information about the timetable
=======================================

Timetables are provided in several ways in AlekSIS. Using the different
views, it is possible to both find information about the regular
lessons taking place, as well as up-to-date information generated from
most recent information, e.g. substitutions, cancellations, or extra lessons.

Viewing the personal timetable
------------------------------

One of the most useful features is the ability to see your daily or weekly
timetable at a glance – with all recent information included. This personal
timetable is provided in your personal calendar. Just open *Calendar** in
the menu and tick the box next to the *Lesson* calendar.

How does the timetable look?
----------------------------

In the timetable, you can see the single lessons. By default, they are
showing the lessons reguraly taking place. Sometimes, they include
current changes like substitutions or cancellations.

The colours of the lessons are defined by the subject of the lesson.
In addition, the following highlighting is done for current changes:

* Substituted lessons are decorated with a red border, and changes
  in the lesson data are struck through and replaced with the
  new information
* Cancelled lessons have their background removed and everything
  is struck through
* Remarks from the substitution plan are added in italics underneath
  the lesson information

For more details on single lessons, just click on them for the following dialog:

Other timetables
----------------

Using the menu entry *Timetables → Timetables* will give you access
to all timetables of your institution (or whatever your administrator
allowed you to see). It's divided into two main sections: On the left side, you
can select the timetable you want to see. You can switch between *Groups*,
*Teachers*, and *Rooms*. Using the search field above the switch, you can filter
the list by their names.

It's divided into three main sections:

* Teachers
* Groups
* Rooms

If you open one of these timetables, you see the current timetable in form of
a calendar. Use the calendar controls to move forward or backwards in time.
Additionally, you can use the arrows on the top right to move forward/backwards
between different timetables in the list.
