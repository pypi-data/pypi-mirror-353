cohere plugin for embcli, a command-line interface for embeddings.

## Reference

- [Cohere’s Embed Models](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/cohere-embed)

## Installation

```bash
pip install embcli-cohere
```

## Quick Start

You need Cohere API key to use this plugin. Set `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file in the current directory. Or you can give the env file path by `-e` option.

```bash
cat .env
COHERE_API_KEY=<YOUR_COHERE_KEY>
```

### Try out the Embedding Models

```bash
# show general usage of emb command.
emb --help

# list all available models.
emb models
CohereEmbeddingModel
    Vendor: cohere
    Models:
    * embed-v4.0 (aliases: embed-v4)
    * embed-english-v3.0 (aliases: embed-en-v3)
    * embed-english-light-v3.0 (aliases: embed-en-light-v3)
    * embed-multilingual-v3.0 (aliases: embed-multiling-v3)
    * embed-multilingual-light-v3.0 (aliases: embed-multiling-light-v3)
    Model Options:
    * input_type (str) - The type of input, affecting how the model processes it. Options include 'search_document', 'search_query', 'classification', 'clustering', 'image'.
    * embedding_type (str) - The type of embeddings to return. Options include 'float', 'int8', 'uint8', 'binary', 'ubinary'
    * truncate (str) - How to handle text inputs that exceed the model's token limit. Options include 'none', 'start', 'end', 'middle'.

# get an embedding for an input text by embed-v4.0 model.
emb embed -m embed-v4 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps."

# get an embedding for an input text by embed-v4.0 model with input_type=search_query.
emb embed -m embed-v4 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o input_type search_query

# get an embedding for an input text by embed-v4.0 model with embedding_type=uint8.
emb embed -m embed-v4 "Embeddings are essential for semantic search and RAG apps." -o embedding_type uint8

# calculate similarity score between two texts by embed-v4.0 model. the default metric is cosine similarity.
emb simscore -m embed-v4 "The cat drifts toward sleep." "Sleep dances in the cat's eyes."

### Document Indexing and Search

You can use the `emb` command to index documents and perform semantic search. `emb` uses [`chroma`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) for the default vector database.

```bash
# index example documents in the current directory.
emb ingest-sample -m embed-v4 -c catcafe --corpus cat-names-en

# or, you can give the path to your documents.
# the documents should be in a CSV file with two columns: id and text. the separator should be comma.
emb ingest -m embed-v4 -c catcafe -f <path-to-your-documents>

# search for a query in the indexed documents.
emb search -m embed-v4 -c catcafe -q "Who's the naughtiest one?"
