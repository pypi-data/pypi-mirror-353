# ttiny
ttiny is a lightweight TUI mode-based text editor for files of all kinds
## Features
### `.7cfg` support
ttiny implements a lighter, faster modified version of [recon7](https://github.com/displaynameishere/recon7)'s config parser and format, `7cfg`. This means you can use the same configuration file for both recon7 and ttiny- useful if you have many theming settings configured and would like to transfer them over.
### Cursor support
ttiny supports moving around with your mouse as well as scrolling through large files
