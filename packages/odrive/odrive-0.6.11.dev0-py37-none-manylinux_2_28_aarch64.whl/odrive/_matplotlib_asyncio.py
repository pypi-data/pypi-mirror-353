"""
Utils to make matplotlib work on the same thread as an asyncio event loop.

matplotlib does not integrate natively with asyncio. When calling plt.show() in
an async function, it blocks the event loop. When calling plt.show(block=False)
in an async function, the figures won't show or be responsive, unless
fig.canvas.flush_events() is called periodically.

The fix in this file works by observing calls that create and destroy matplotlib
figure managers.
Whenever there's at least one figure manager, an asyncio task is started that
periodically flushes the events of each canvas.
Furthermore, `import` calls are observed to install the hooks when needed.

On some backends (e.g. macOS), resizing the windows can still block the asyncio
event loop.


Side Note
=========

Tighter integration is theoretically possible by implementing platform/backend-
specific low level functions ("input hooks") that can wait for matplotlib GUI
events _and_ one other file descriptor (e.g. os.pipe()). This is what IPython /
prompt_toolkit does (so figures can be open while IPython remains responsive).

IPython ships with several input hooks:
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/main/IPython/terminal/pt_inputhooks

prompt_toolkit uses asyncio.SelectorEventLoop and a separate thread to funnel
asyncio events into a pipe that can wake up the input hook:
https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/src/prompt_toolkit/eventloop/inputhook.py

However due to the complexity and backend-dependence, we reject this approach
and use a polling loop instead.
