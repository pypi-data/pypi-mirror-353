## Data Format

- data format for information fully describing the scheduler instance - JSON

example:
```JSON
{
  "schedule_name": "MySchedule",
  "time_slots": [
    {
      "start_time": "2024-03-01T09:00:00",
      "end_time": "2024-03-01T11:00:00"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "Design Phase",
      "description": "Initial design work",
      "deadline": "2024-03-05T17:00:00",
      "duration": 360,
      "completion": 45,
      "subtasks": [
        {
          "name": "UI Mockups",
          "duration": 120,
          "completion": 75
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Visualisation Examples

## Remarks and Recommendations for Users


- using the **view_next** command is the fastest way to view details about the next scheduled task

- each scheduler instance stores two data files: schedule_state.json (storing all information input by the user), schedule.json (storing the result of the latest scheduling).
  - rescheduling happens automatically after all kinds of edits and operations, not upon calling the command **view_schedule** or **view_next** however! This commands loads directly the schedule.json file, thus removing the need of schedule recalculation in series of view_schedule calls
  - you can use the command **schedule_tasks** to recalculate your schedule - this command also lists impossible-to-schedule tasks in the terminal assuming your current settings

- when creating a command for periodic scheduling of a task a mask composed of week_day, day, month and year is used. If any of these components are not specified, they are not matched against the current date. Command ```schedule_tasks``` must be called to schedule periodic tasks. Note: periodic tasks are scheduled regardless of how recently they were completed.

- when creating or updating a task the deadline can be set relative to the current date. This is the format [today/monday/tuesday/.../sunday]+[0/1/...]. Example: monday+0 (the very next monday)

- it may be a good idea to occasionally save a version of your scheduler. For this purpose the command **merge** can be used. Example: ``` task-scheduler merge -n MySchedule_backup -ns MySchedule ```
  
- note that the order in which subtasks are added to a task is respected in scheduling. This is useful in situations when subtasks depend on the completion of preceding subtasks

- it only has an effect to edit completion/duration attributes of leaf tasks (tasks with 0 subtasks) since these attributes of tasks higher in the hierarchy are calculated based on those of the leaf tasks

- conversely, it only has an effect to edit deadlines of top-level tasks (highest in the task hierarchy). Deadlines of the rest of the tasks always corresponds to that of their ancestor

- the **view_calendar** command only shows the number of tasks and total completion of tasks (weighed by duration) having deadlines on each given day (note: not being scheduled on but having a deadline on). To show more details about individual tasks due by a given day use **common_deadline**. Exapmle: ``` task-scheduler common_deadline MySchedule -m 12 -d 25``` (if you leave out the -m option the current month is chosen by default)

- this application requires that **vim** be installed on your system. In certain scenarios, vim motions can be more efficient than editing your settings through **interactive mode** e.g. adding multiple time slots. You can use the command **update_time_slots** to edit/add/remove your time slots using the vim interface. Another example would be editing deadline/description of a specific task. This you can too achieve through the vim interface using the **update_task** command leaving out the argument for the option --name/--description/--deadline. Example: ``` task-scheduler update_task MySchedule MyTask --description ```

- a colorful terminal application is required to get color-coded outputs in terminal

- the application was so far tuned mainly for Unix-based operating systems (it works in windows as well but operations in the **interactive mode** are recommended to be carried out mainly by mouse clicks to avoid lag)

- the pip installs the source files and the JSON data files in two separate directories. Consequently, upon reinstalling the package your data are not deleted from the file system on your machine. If you want to uninstall for good the data files have to be deleted manually - ``` pip -V ``` command can be used to find the path to the package installation. Then look for the data/ directory.
