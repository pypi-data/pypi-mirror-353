    r"""
    Generates path candidates using shooting-and-bouncing of rays

    This is a callable object that returns the candidates as a
    :class:`~sionna.rt.PathsBuffer` object.

    Paths flagged as valid, i.e., for which the entry in
    ``PathsBuffer.valid`` is set to `True`, are finalized: They connect a source
    to a target. Note that only paths ending with a diffuse reflection can
    be finalized through shooting-and-bouncing of rays and are therefore flagged
    as valid.

    Specular chains, which consists only of specular reflections and/or
    refractions, are only candidates. They require additional processing,
    e.g., using the image method, to either refine them to valid paths or to
    discard them.

    Similarly, paths ending by a specular suffix also require further
    processing. Neither specular chains nor paths ending by a specular suffix
    are flagged as valid.

    This generator ensures that all specular chain candidates are uniquely
    present in the returned buffer. This uniqueness is ensured through hashing
    of the paths. Note that this can causes loss of candidates due to hash
    collisions.

    # Specular chains are considered identical if they share the same
    # hash. An array is used to store the number of times that a hash has
    # been observed. If the counter is > 0, then the specular chain is not
    # considered as new and not saved as a candidate. This array is indexed by
    # taking the hash modulo the size of this array. The size of this array
    # needs therefore to be large enough to ensure that the number of collisions
    # stays low and that candidates are not discarded due to collisions. The
