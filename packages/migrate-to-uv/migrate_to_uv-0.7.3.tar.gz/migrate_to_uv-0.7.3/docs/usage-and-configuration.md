# Usage and configuration

## Basic usage

```bash
# With uv
uvx migrate-to-uv

# With pipx
pipx run migrate-to-uv
```

## Configuration

### Project path

By default, `migrate-to-uv` uses the current directory to search for the project to migrate. If the project is in a
different path, you can set the path to a directory as a positional argument, like so:

```bash
# Relative path
migrate-to-uv subdirectory

# Absolute path
migrate-to-uv /home/foo/project
```

### Arguments

While `migrate-to-uv` tries, as much as possible, to match what the original package manager defines for a project
when migrating the metadata to uv, there are features that could be present in a package manager that does not exist in
uv, or behave differently. Mainly for those reasons, `migrate-to-uv` offers a few options.

#### `--dry-run`

This runs the migration, but without modifying the files. Instead, it prints the changes that would have been made in
the terminal.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --dry-run
```

#### `--skip-lock`

By default, `migrate-to-uv` locks dependencies with `uv lock` at the end of the migration. This flag disables this
behavior.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --skip-lock
```

#### `--skip-uv-checks`

By default, `migrate-to-uv` will exit early if it sees that a project is already using `uv`.
This flag disables that behavior, allowing `migrate-to-uv` to run on a `pyproject.toml`
which already has `uv` configured.

Note that the project must also have a valid non-`uv` package manager configured,
or else it will fail to generate the `uv` configuration.

**Example:**

```bash
migrate-to-uv --skip-uv-checks
```

#### `--ignore-locked-versions`

By default, when locking dependencies with `uv lock`, `migrate-to-uv` keeps dependencies to the versions they were
locked to with the previous package manager, if it supports lock files, and if a lock file is found. This behavior can
be disabled, in which case dependencies will be locked to the highest possible versions allowed by the dependencies
constraints.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --ignore-locked-versions
```

#### `--replace-project-section`

By default, existing data in `[project]` section of `pyproject.toml` is preserved when migrating. This flag allows
completely replacing existing content.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --replace-project-section
```

#### `--package-manager`

By default, `migrate-to-uv` tries to auto-detect the package manager based on the files (and their content) used by the
package managers it supports. If auto-detection does not work in some cases, or if you prefer to explicitly specify the
package manager, this option could be used.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --package-manager poetry
```

#### `--dependency-groups-strategy`

Most package managers that support dependency groups install dependencies from all groups when performing installation.
By default, uv will [only install `dev` one](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#default-groups).

In order to match the workflow in the current package manager as closely as possible, by default, `migrate-to-uv` will
move each dependency group to its corresponding one in uv, and set all dependency groups in `default-groups` under
`[tool.uv]` section (unless the only dependency group is `dev` one, as this is already uv's default).

If this is not desirable, it is possible to change the strategy by using `--dependency-groups-strategy <VALUE>`, where
`<VALUE>` can be one of the following:

- `set-default-groups` (default): Move each dependency group to its corresponding uv dependency group, and add all
  dependency groups in `default-groups` under `[tool.uv]` section (unless the only dependency group is `dev` one, as
  this is already uv's default)
- `include-in-dev`:  Move each dependency group to its corresponding uv dependency group, and reference all dependency
  groups (others than `dev` one) in `dev` dependency group by using `{ include-group = "<group>" }`
- `keep-existing`: Move each dependency group to its corresponding uv dependency group, without any further action
- `merge-into-dev`: Merge dependencies from all dependency groups into `dev` dependency group

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --dependency-groups-strategy include-in-dev
```

#### `--requirements-file`

Names of the production requirements files to look for, for projects using `pip` or `pip-tools`. The argument can be set
multiple times, if there are multiple files.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --requirements-file requirements.txt --requirements-file more-requirements.txt
```

#### `--dev-requirements-file`

Names of the development requirements files to look for, for projects using `pip` or `pip-tools`. The argument can be
set multiple times, if there are multiple files.

**Example**:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --dev-requirements-file requirements-dev.txt --dev-requirements-file requirements-docs.txt
```

#### `--keep-current-data`

Keep the current package manager data (lock file, sections in `pyproject.toml`, ...) after the migration, if you want to
handle the cleaning yourself, or want to compare the differences first.

### Authentication for private indexes

By default, `migrate-to-uv` generates `uv.lock` with `uv lock` to lock dependencies. If you currently use a package
manager with private indexes, credentials will need to be set for locking to work properly. This can be done by setting
the [same environment variables as uv expects for private indexes](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/#providing-credentials).

Since the names of the indexes in uv should be the same as the ones in the current package manager before the migration,
you should be able to adapt the environment variables based on what you previously used.

For instance, if you currently use Poetry and have:

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "foo-bar"
url = "https://private-index.example.com"
priority = "supplementary"
```

Credentials would be set with the following environment variables:

- `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_FOO_BAR_USERNAME`
- `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_FOO_BAR_PASSWORD`

For uv, this would translate to:

- `UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_USERNAME`
- `UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_PASSWORD`

To forward those credentials to `migrate-to-uv`, you can either export them beforehand, or set the environment variables
when invoking the command:

```bash
# Either
export UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_USERNAME=<username>
export UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_PASSWORD=<password>
migrate-to-uv

# Or
UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_USERNAME=<username> \
  UV_INDEX_FOO_BAR_PASSWORD=<password> \
  migrate-to-uv
```
