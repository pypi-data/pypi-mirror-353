"""Poker Game Play

This module implements the core poker game logic, including game state management,
card dealing, and street progression. It supports multiple poker variants through
class inheritance and provides a flexible framework for different poker games.

Classes:
    GameStreet: Enum representing the different streets in a poker hand
    Game: Base class for poker games with common functionality
    GameTexasHoldem: Texas Hold'em specific game implementation
    GameTexasHoldemRegular: Regular Texas Hold'em with small/big blinds
    GameTexasHoldemBomb: Texas Hold'em variant with a bomb pot (forced all-in)
