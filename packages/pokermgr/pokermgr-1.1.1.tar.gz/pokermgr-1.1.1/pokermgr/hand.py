"""Poker Hand Module

This module defines the Hand class, which represents a poker hand in the game.
A hand consists of cards and associated metadata like hand type, weight, and draws.

class Hand:
    """Represents a poker hand with cards and associated metadata.
    
    This class stores information about a poker hand, including the cards it contains,
    the type of hand (pair, flush, etc.), its weight for comparison, and any potential
    draws. It's designed to work with bitmask representations of cards for efficiency.
    
    Attributes:
        cards: Integer bitmask representing the cards in the hand.
        type_key: Numeric identifier for the hand type (e.g., pair, flush).
        type_name: Human-readable name of the hand type.
        weight: Numeric value representing the hand's strength for comparison.
        draws: Bitmask representing potential draws (e.g., flush draw, straight draw).
        range_code: Poker hand range code (e.g., 'AKs' for Ace-King suited).
        
    Example:
        >>> from cardspy.deck import cards_to_mask
        >>> # Create a hand with Ace-King suited
        >>> hand = Hand(cards_to_mask(['Ah', 'Kh']))
        >>> hand.type_key = 1  # Example: pair
        >>> hand.type_name = "Pair"
        >>> hand.weight = 1000
