Poker Hand Utility Functions
===========================

This module provides utility functions for evaluating and analyzing poker hands using bitmask representations. Functions include detection of pairs, suited cards, straight/flush draws, hand range code generation, and hand strength evaluation.

Main Features:
--------------
- Count pairs, suited cards, and connected cards using bitwise operations
- Detect open-ended and gutshot straight draws, flush draws
- Generate hand range codes (e.g., 'AKs', 'QJo') from bitmask
- Compute hand strength/weight for all standard poker hands (pair, two pairs, trips, straight, flush, etc.)
- Helpers for board evaluation and property extraction

Example Usage:
--------------
>>> from pokermgr.funcs import get_paired, get_suited, get_range_codes
>>> # Suppose 'cards' is a bitmask representing Ah, Kh, Qh, Jh, Th (royal flush in hearts)
>>> paired = get_paired(cards, 2)
>>> suited = get_suited(cards, 5)
>>> ranges = get_range_codes(cards)
>>> print(f"Pairs: {paired}, Suited: {suited}, Ranges: {ranges}")
Pairs: 0, Suited: 1, Ranges: ['AKs', 'AQs', 'AJs', 'ATs', 'KQs', 'KJs', 'KTs', 'QJs', 'QTs', 'JTs']

See individual function docstrings for more details and examples.
