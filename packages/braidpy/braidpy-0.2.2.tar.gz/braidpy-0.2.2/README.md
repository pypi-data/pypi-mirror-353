# BraidPy

A Python library for working with braids, with the goal to help design real world complex 3D braids, using recent
advances in braid theory. Source is available at on [github](https://github.com/baptistelabat/braidpy)

## Features

- [x] Mathematical representation of braids with braid words using Artin's generators
- [x] Conversion between different braid word formats
- [x] Braid operations and manipulations (inversion, handles reduction, ...)
- [x] Generation of parametric braid from braid word
- [x] Visualization capabilities (ASCI, 2D and 3D) 
- [x] Computations of mathematical properties of braid word or invariants of braid
- [ ] Annulus braids
- [ ] Conversion from parametric braid to braid word
- [ ] Conversion from material braid to parametric braid
- [ ] Simulation of machine braiding process (hexagonal braiding machine)

## Basic example

```python
from braidpy import Braid

# Create a braid
b = Braid([1, 2, -1])

# Perform operations
result = b * b.inverse()
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Release versions are available on Pypi and it should be very easy to install braidpy in your python environment.

Using pip
```bash
pip install braidpy
```

Or using poetry
```bash
poetry add braidpy
```

Or using uv (recommended package manager used on the project)
```bash
uv add braidpy
```
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation from source
The version in pypi might lack features or bug corrections compared to the development versions.

You can download the code directly from GitHub or using git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:baptistelabat/braidpy.git
```
By default, you should be on the 'develop' branch.

To install the required dependencies, follow the steps below:

2. On linux, run the commands from root of repository to install uv. Use the official [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) otherwise.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   cd braidpy
   make install-uv
   ```
---

## Test
To launch the complete suite of tests, launch the following command:
```bash
uv run pytest tests
```
Alternatively, if you have make install, just run:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## üìú Documentation
Documentation of released versions is hosted by [readthedocs] (https://braidpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Documentation of development version can be found on [github pages] (https://baptistelabat.github.io/braidpy)
You should be able to select among several versions. Note that this process is manual.
You can also generate the documentation for your version installed from sources
   ```bash
   make docs
   ```
