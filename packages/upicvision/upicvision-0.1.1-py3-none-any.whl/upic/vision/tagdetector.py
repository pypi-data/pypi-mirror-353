    A comprehensive AprilTag detection system for real-time computer vision applications.
    
    This class provides a complete solution for detecting AprilTags from camera feeds with
    configurable detection strategies, automatic resource management, and thread-safe operation.
    It supports both single-tag and multi-tag detection scenarios with various selection methods.

    built-in camera buffer management for optimal real-time performance.
