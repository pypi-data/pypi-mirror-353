# navground

Navground, short for **Nav**igation Play**ground**, is a playground to experiment with navigation algorithms. It is a modular library, primary implemented in C++.

This distribution provides the ``navground.core`` and ``navground.simulation`` Python packages and a CLI.

## Core

A library of two-dimensional navigation algorithms which
provides a common API to interact with dynamic obstacle avoidance behaviors for multi-agent systems. Some behaviors are already implemented, more will be. Behaviors take the current state of environment and agent together with a target, and output a control command. 

### Features

- navigation behaviors and modulations
- environment states
- targets
- kinematics
- 2D and 2.5D controllers with an event-based interface
- collisions computation
- YAML serialization

Users can add their components (behaviors and kinematics) which are then auto-discovered by the rest of the system.

The core library is designed to be integrated in real-time run-times of real or simulated robots or of other kind of agents.

## Simulation

The simulation complements the navigation behaviors of the core library with:
- tasks that generate targets for behaviors, and
- state estimation components that feed a potentially noisy and partial representation of the environment state to the behaviors.

It also provides all the infrastructure to run offline experiments.

### Features

- very fast kinematic simulation
- extensible tasks and state estimations
- generating world with agents and static obstacles from scenarios
- running experiments/benchmarks and recording data in HFD5 files
- using YAML to specify experiments
