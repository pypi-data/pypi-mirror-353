**Haconiwa (箱庭)** is an AI collaborative development support Python CLI tool. This next-generation tool integrates tmux session management, git-worktree integration, task management, and AI agent coordination to provide an efficient development environment.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is currently under active development. Features and APIs may change frequently.

## 🚀 Ready-to-Use Features

### tmux Multi-Agent Environment (Implemented)

Create and manage a 4x4 grid multi-agent development environment **right now**:

```bash
# 1. Installation
pip install haconiwa

# 2. Create multi-agent environment (4 organizations × 4 roles = 16 panes)
haconiwa space multiagent --name my-project \
  --org01-name "Frontend Development" --task01 "UI Design" \
  --org02-name "Backend Development" --task02 "API Development" \
  --org03-name "Database Team" --task03 "Schema Design" \
  --org04-name "DevOps Team" --task04 "Infrastructure"

# 3. List sessions
haconiwa space list

# 4. Attach to existing session
haconiwa space attach my-project

# 5. Update session settings (rename existing session)
haconiwa space multiagent --name my-project \
  --org01-name "New Frontend Team" --task01 "React Development" \
  --no-attach

# 6. Terminate session
haconiwa space kill my-project
```

**✅ Actually Working Features:**
- 🏢 **Multi-Agent Environment**: 4x4 (16 panes) organizational tmux layout
- 📁 **Auto Directory Structure**: Automatic workspace creation by organization/role
- 🏷️ **Custom Organization & Task Names**: Dynamic title configuration
- 🔄 **Session Updates**: Safe configuration changes for existing sessions
- 📋 **Session Management**: Complete support for create/list/attach/delete

## ✨ Key Features (In Development)

- 🤖 **AI Agent Management**: Create and monitor Boss/Worker agents
- 📦 **World Management**: Build and manage development environments  
- 🖥️ **tmux Session Integration**: Efficient development space management
- 📋 **Task Management**: Task management system integrated with git-worktree
- 📊 **Resource Management**: Efficient scanning of databases and file paths
- 👁️ **Real-time Monitoring**: Progress monitoring of agents and tasks

## 🏗️ Architecture Concepts

### tmux ↔ Haconiwa Concept Mapping

| tmux Concept | Haconiwa Concept | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Session** | **Company** | Top-level management unit representing entire project |
| **Window** | **Room** | Functional work areas for specific roles and functions |
| **Pane** | **Desk** | Individual workspaces for concrete task execution |

### Logical Hierarchy Management

```
Company
├── Building         ← Logical management layer (tmux-independent)
│   └── Floor        ← Logical management layer (tmux-independent)
│       └── Room     ← tmux Window
│           └── Desk ← tmux Pane
```

**Logical Management Layer Features:**
- **Building**: Major project categories (Frontend Building, Backend Building, etc.)
- **Floor**: Functional classifications (Development Floor, Testing Floor, Deploy Floor, etc.)
- These layers are managed logically within haconiwa without direct tmux session mapping

### Organization Structure Model

```
Organization
├── PM (Project Manager)
│   ├── Overall coordination
│   ├── Task assignment
│   └── Progress management
└── Worker
    ├── Worker-A (Development)
    ├── Worker-B (Testing)
    └── Worker-C (Deployment)
```

**Role Definitions:**
- **PM (Boss)**: Strategic decision-making, resource management, quality assurance
- **Worker**: Implementation, testing, deployment and other execution tasks
- **Organization**: Logical team unit composed of multiple PMs/Workers

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install haconiwa
```

> 📝 **Development Note**: The package is available on PyPI but many features are still in development.

haconiwa agent spawn boss

# Create worker agent
haconiwa agent spawn worker-a
```

### 5. Task Management
```bash
# Create new task
haconiwa task new feature-login

# Assign task to agent
haconiwa task assign feature-login worker-a

# Monitor progress
haconiwa watch tail worker-a
```
