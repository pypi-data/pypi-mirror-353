        Please copy of the command-line output while Napari was running and produced the error below (you can use [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to format as a [code block](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code) using triple backticks). At a minimum this should include the bottom section showing where the error arose and the subsequent output. If there is no output and an image shows the problem please paste a URL to that image here. If able to include any images which demonstrate the problem please attach them using the paper clip in the menu above. Screenshots invariably miss out some information.
