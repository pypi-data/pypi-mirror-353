## Development

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package installer and resolver

Install the project with development dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run -m pytest
```

Run linters and static analysis:

```bash
uv run ruff .
uv run black --check --diff src tests
uv run pyright
```

For test coverage:

```bash
uv run -m pytest --cov=src
```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- Automated testing on Python 3.10
- Code linting with flake8
- Format checking with Black

The CI workflow runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests. You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab in GitHub.
