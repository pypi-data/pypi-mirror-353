An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that brings powerful AWS FinOps capabilities directly into your AI assistant. Analyze cloud costs, audit for waste, and get budget insights using natural language, all while keeping your credentials secure on your local machine.

### Why Use the AWS FinOps MCP Server?

Managing AWS costs can be complex. Finding answers to questions like "What did we spend on S3 last month?" or "Do we have any unused EC2 instances?" often requires navigating the AWS Console or writing scripts.

This server bridges that gap by connecting the powerful, natural language understanding of an LLM directly to your AWS account's financial data. You can ask complex questions and get immediate, actionable insights without ever leaving your chat interface.

#### Use Cases:

> **Prompt on Claude Desktop:** "Get `usage-type` based cost for all my AWS CLI profiles for the last 90 days. And get the `audit report` for all profiles for region `ap-south-1`. Make a finops report with data in minimalistic way and keep it professional."

> **Prompt on Amazon Q CLI:** "Could you use `aws-finops` mcp server and get cost data for each month in the last 6 months for `profile 04` and present the data in a tabular format highlighting how the total cost and cost for each service has changed every month?"

> **Prompt on Claude Desktop:** "Generate a comprehensive finops report for management using all the tools available in the AWS FinOps MCP server. Use all the available CLI profiles and use the region ap-south-1 wherever required."

### Key Features

-   **Detailed Cost Analysis**: Query your AWS cost data using tags, time ranges, and service groupings.
-   **Automated FinOps Audit**: Instantly find common sources of cloud waste, such as stopped EC2 instances, unattached EBS volumes, and unassociated Elastic IPs etc.
-   **Budget Monitoring**: Check the status of your AWS Budgets to see if you are on track, over budget, or forecasted to exceed your limits.
-   **Multi-Profile & Multi-Region**: Seamlessly query across any or all of your configured AWS accounts and regions in a single command.
-   **Secure by Design**: Your AWS credentials **never leave your machine**. The server runs locally and uses your existing AWS CLI configuration to make API calls directly to AWS.

### Prerequisites

#### General Requirements

-   **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
-   **MCP Client**: An application that supports MCP. This guide uses [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) as the example.

#### AWS Requirements & IAM Permissions

-   **AWS CLI**: The [AWS CLI must be installed](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your machine.
-   **AWS Account & Profile(s)**: You need at least one configured AWS profile.
-   **IAM Permissions**: The AWS identity (IAM User or Role) associated with your profile(s) requires specific read-only permissions to function correctly.

Create an IAM policy with the following JSON and attach it to your user or role. These permissions are **read-only** and grant access only to the necessary services.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowFinOpsMCPServer",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
                "budgets:DescribeBudgets",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Installation

There are several ways to install the AWS FinOps MCP Server:

### Option 1: Using pipx (Recommended)
```bash
pipx install aws-finops-mcp-server
```

If you don't have `pipx`, install it with:

```bash
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

### Option 2: Using uv (Fast Python Package Installer)
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package installer and resolver that's extremely fast.

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it yet
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create project directory
mkdir aws-finops-mcp-server && cd aws-finops-mcp-server

# Create and activate python virtual environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install aws-finops-dashboard
uv pip install aws-finops-mcp-server
```

### Option 3: From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ravikiranvm/aws-finops-mcp-server.git
cd aws-finops-mcp-server

# Create and activate python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install using pip
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

#### Step 1: AWS CLI Profile Setup

If you haven't already, configure your AWS profiles. For each profile you want to use, run:

```bash
aws configure --profile your-profile-name
```

The CLI will prompt you for:
-   `AWS Access Key ID`: Your credential's access key.
-   `AWS Secret Access Key`: Your credential's secret key.
-   `Default region name`: e.g., `us-east-1`.
-   `Default output format`: e.g., `json`.

For your default profile, you can omit the `--profile` flag.

#### Step 2: MCP Client Setup (Claude for Desktop)

To use this server with Claude for Desktop, you need to tell the application how to run it.

1.  Open your Claude for Desktop configuration file. It's located at:
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2.  Add the following entry to the `mcpServers` object. If the file doesn't exist or is empty, you'll need to create the JSON structure.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aws_finops": {
          "command": "aws-finops-mcp-server",
          "args": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  Save the file and **completely restart Claude for Desktop**.

After restarting, the server will launch in the background, and its tools will be available to Claude.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> After installing this tool (e.g., via `pipx install aws-finops-mcp-server`), ensure the `aws-finops-mcp-server` command is available in your system's `PATH`.  
> 
> To check where it's installed, run:
> 
> ```bash
> which aws-finops-mcp-server
> ```
>
> If it returns a path like `/Users/yourname/.local/bin/aws-finops-mcp-server`, but it's **not in your PATH**, you have two options:
>
> - Run `pipx ensurepath` and restart your terminal, **or**
> - Use the full path in your `mcpServers` config:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "aws_finops": {
>       "command": "/full/path/to/aws-finops-mcp-server",
>       "args": []
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

### Usage & Example Prompts

You can now ask questions about your AWS finances in plain English.

#### Use Case: Cost & Usage Analysis

> **Basic Query:**
> "Show me my AWS costs for the `default` profile this month."

> **Time-Range Query:**
> "get aws cost for my `dev` profile for the last 14 days"

> **Filtered & Grouped Query:**
> "What was the cost for my `production` profile last month, filtered by the tag `CostCenter=Project-Alpha`, and grouped by `INSTANCE_TYPE`?"

> **Multi-Profile Query:**
> "Compare the costs for my `staging` and `production` profiles over the last 30 days."

#### Use Case: FinOps Waste & Savings Audit

> **Simple Audit:**
> "Run a finops audit on my `default` profile in `us-east-1`."

> **Multi-Region, Multi-Profile Audit:**
> "Check for unused resources in `us-west-2` and `eu-west-1` for my `prod-us` and `prod-eu` profiles."

> **Comprehensive Audit for All Profiles:**
> "Run a FinOps audit for all my configured profiles in `us-east-1`."

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `profiles` | `List[str]` | A list of AWS CLI profile names to use. |
| `all_profiles` | `bool` | If `True`, use all available profiles. Defaults to `False`. |
| `time_range_days`| `int` | Number of past days to fetch data for (e.g., `7` for last 7 days). |

### Cost Considerations

This tool interacts with the AWS Cost Explorer API. AWS charges for these API calls.
-   **Cost:** Every time you use `get_cost` tool, it makes 2 calls to the Cost Explorer API and it costs **$0.01**.
-   The `run_finops_audit` tool calls other AWS service APIs (EC2, Budgets) which are generally included in the free tier or have negligible costs at typical usage levels.
