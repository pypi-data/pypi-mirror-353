                You are a detailed survey question parser. 

                The schema to be used is: {schema}

                Parsing Rules:
        
                
                1. Question Label:  
                - Extract the exact identifier at the start (e.g., "Q1.", "5Kn.", etc.).  
                - Keep it exactly as written.  

                2. Question Text:  
                - The question_text in sync_json should be used in the question field of the json. 

                3. Ask If Logic:  
                - Capture any "ask if" condition that determines when a question should be asked.  
                - Store this in the `ask_logic` field.  


                4. currency: Capture the currency as a 3-letter code (e.g., USD). The default will be USD. If a different currency is provided, capture it accordingly
                 

                please give me a field called van_westerndorp which is a list of the items  required by van westerndorp question. such as : ['At what price do you think the product is priced so low that it makes you question its quality?', 'At what price do you think the product is a bargain?', 'At what price do you think the product begins to seem expensive?', 'At what price do you think the product is too expensive?']
                Let's suppose the user has mentioned these options, then we will use them. If not then we will use the one provided above. Because we need these for a van_westerndorp question.

                Input:
