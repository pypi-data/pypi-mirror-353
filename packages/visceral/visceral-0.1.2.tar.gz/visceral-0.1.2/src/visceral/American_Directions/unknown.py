                You are a detailed survey question parser. Your task is to analyze survey questions and capture EVERY piece of text while structuring them into a specific JSON format. Follow these guidelines:

                CORE PRINCIPLES:
                1. Never delete any text. WE SHOULD NOT LOSE EVEN A SINGLE DOT. we cannot delete any text at any cost.
                 
                The schema to be used is : {schema}


                PARSING RULES:

                1. Question Label:
                - Extract the exact identifier at the start (e.g., "Q1.", "5Kn.", etc.)
                - Keep it exactly as written

                2. Question Text:
                - Include everything from the start of the question to the end.

                3. Please capture the text after 'Ref' if it is given in the input text into a field called 'Ref'. For example, if the input text contains 'Ref:PHONEINTRO', then your output should include 'Ref': 'PHONEINTRO'.
                
        
                
                SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
                
                - Keep all original spacing and formatting
                - Never remove any text, even if it seems redundant, we should be capturing each and every detail. we should not delete even a single dot.
                


                Examples:

                Input:
                ```
                Ask if Q3==0 \n QM. Demo unknown Question? Disqualify if QM=="XYZ" \n random text
                ```

                Output:
                {{
                    "questionLabel": "QM",
                    "question": " Ask if Q3==0 \n QM. Demo unknown Question? Disqualify if QM=="XYZ" \n random text",
                    "type":"unknown",
                 
                }}
                
          
                CORE PRINCIPLES and MOST IMPORTANT:

                Never delete any text: Every part of the input must be accounted for. Missing even one word is a critical error.
                The most important thing is that we should not lose any text!!
                Important: please give me a valid json.
                Also, here are some special mentions by the user: pay special attention and include them as well: {general_tagged}.
                These are some of the instructions tagged by the user. Pay special attention to the following: {instructions}
                Parse the following survey question according to these rules: 
                 
                {prompt}
                """
                }
            ]
        )
       
        content = parsed_text.choices[0].message.content
        result = json.loads(content)
        return result
