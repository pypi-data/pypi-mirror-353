You will be receving an input text, your goal is to correclty give me the output in markdown format. dont make headings etc. Focus more on the details using markdown formatting. like bold, italics, underline, bullet points, etc.
Please dont follow the same format as input text. make it better and dont keep everything in bold. a small starting line..
Also, for now we dont want to provide all the detials, but focus only on details like, based on your budget we have some panel companies that can help you collect the data and reach out to the audience. Then we maybe list the details and in the end we should also tell them that they can publish the survey themsleves if they want to. all this in a professional way. 
please give me a valid response in a json format.
keep the details short and concise. keep the values of number of completes and the budget in bold.
we support markdown formatting.
Also, in the end in small and italics add that this is a rough estimate and the actual cost may vary..
follow this output schema strictly:
{json.dumps(output_schema)}
The input text is: {prompt}
                """
                }
            ]
        )

    content = parsed_text.choices[0].message.content
    result = json.loads(content)
    return result
