# Automatic Memory System Guide

## Overview

The SecureAgents framework features a **completely automatic** memory system with ChromaDB backend. Agents intelligently store and retrieve information during processing **without any manual memory management required**.

## Key Features

- **Zero Manual Memory Management**: No `remember()` or `recall()` calls needed
- **ChromaDB Backend**: Vector-based storage for intelligent retrieval  
- **Automatic Intelligence**: System decides what to store and when
- **Multiple Memory Types**: Session, Working, Long-term, and Pattern memories
- **Encryption**: All memories are encrypted before storage
- **Context-Aware**: Automatic retrieval during operations
- **User Isolation**: Each user has isolated memory spaces

## üöÄ Quick Start - Automatic Memory

### Step 1: Create Expert with Automatic Memory

```python
from tbh_secure_agents import Expert

# Create expert with automatic memory - that's it!
expert = Expert(
    specialty="Research Specialist in AI Technology",
    objective="Conduct comprehensive research on AI implementations",
    background="Expert researcher with data analysis capabilities",
    memory_duration="auto",  # üëà Everything automatic from here!
    user_id="researcher_001"
)
```

### Step 2: Use Normally - Memory Happens Automatically

```python
# Just process content - memory storage is completely automatic!
from tbh_secure_agents import Operation

operation = Operation(
    instructions="""
    Research AI-powered customer service automation.
    Focus on ROI data and implementation best practices.
    """,
    expected_output="Comprehensive research analysis",
    expert=expert  # üëà Expert automatically stores important findings
)

# Execute - all important info is remembered automatically
result = operation.execute()

# The expert automatically remembers:
# - Research findings and data points
# - ROI statistics and trends  
# - Implementation best practices
# - Context for future operations
```
# - Product interest (wireless headphones)  
# - Customer communication style
# No manual memory calls needed!
```

### Step 3: Benefit from Automatic Context

```python
# Later conversation - expert automatically recalls previous context
later_operation = Operations(
    operation_name="Follow-up Support",
    operation_description="Continue helping customer", 
    expert=expert,  # Same expert with memory
    operation_steps=[
        "Recall customer's previous interests automatically",
        "Build on previous conversation context",
        "Provide personalized recommendations"
    ],
    expected_output="Personalized response using automatic memory"
)

# Expert automatically knows about the $200 budget and headphone interest!
result = later_operation.execute(inputs={
    "customer_message": "Do you have any sales on the headphones we discussed?"
})
```

## üîß Memory Duration Options

Choose how aggressively your Expert should remember information:

### `memory_duration="auto"` (Recommended)
- **What it does**: Framework automatically decides what's important to remember
- **Best for**: Most use cases - intelligent, balanced memory
- **Storage**: Persistent SQLite database
- **Behavior**: Remembers key information, decisions, and user preferences

```python
expert = Expert(
    expert_name="Smart Assistant",
    memory_enabled=True,
    memory_duration="auto"  # üëà Smart automatic memory
)
```

### `memory_duration="long_term"`
- **What it does**: Remembers everything important for long-term use
- **Best for**: Customer service, personal assistants, learning applications
- **Storage**: Persistent SQLite database
- **Behavior**: Aggressive memory retention

```python
expert = Expert(
    expert_name="Personal Assistant", 
    memory_enabled=True,
    memory_duration="long_term"  # üëà Remember everything important
)
```

### `memory_duration="short_term"`
- **What it does**: Remembers information only for current session
- **Best for**: Temporary tasks, privacy-sensitive applications
- **Storage**: In-memory (cleared when app restarts)
- **Behavior**: Session-only memory

```python
expert = Expert(
    expert_name="Session Helper",
    memory_enabled=True, 
    memory_duration="short_term"  # üëà Session-only memory
)
```

### `memory_duration="disabled"`
- **What it does**: No automatic memory
- **Best for**: Stateless operations, high-privacy scenarios
- **Storage**: None
- **Behavior**: No memory retention

```python
expert = Expert(
    expert_name="Stateless Agent",
    memory_enabled=False,  # üëà No memory
    memory_duration="disabled"
)
```

expert = Expert(expert_name="Agent", memory_enabled=True)

# Manual memory calls throughout code
expert.remember(content="User likes mornings", memory_type="LONG_TERM")
result = expert.recall(query="user preferences")
expert.remember(content="Successful strategy", memory_type="LONG_TERM")
```

### After (Automatic)
```python
# New automatic approach  
expert = Expert(
    expert_name="Agent", 
    memory_enabled=True,
    memory_duration="auto"  # üëà Just enable automatic memory
)

# Remove all manual remember() and recall() calls
# Memory happens automatically during operations!
```
