# RoboEnum

RoboEnum is a modular HTTP enumeration and fingerprinting tool designed for reconnaissance and security assessments. It automates the discovery of endpoints, fetches and parses TLS certificate info, fingerprint favicons, identifies HTTP methods, and more — all while aggregating results in JSON for easy consumption.

---

## Features

- **Target Discovery**: Enumerate accessible endpoints and files from robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
- **TLS Certificate Info**: Extract and store certificate subject, issuer, validity, and fingerprints.
- **Favicon Hashing**: Fetch favicons and generate MD5 and SHA256 hashes for fingerprinting.
- **HTTP Methods Enumeration**: Detect allowed HTTP methods on discovered endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and invalid responses.
- **JSON Output**: Save or append structured JSON output for integration or post-processing.
- **Configurable Logging**: Console output with colorized logs and clean file logging.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily add new fingerprinting or enumeration modules.
