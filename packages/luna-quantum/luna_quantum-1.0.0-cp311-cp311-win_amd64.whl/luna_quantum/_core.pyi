class Vtype(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of variable types supported by the optimization system.

    This enum defines the type of a variable used in a model. The type influences
    the domain and behavior of the variable during optimization. It is often passed
    when defining variables to specify how they should behave.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Real : Vtype
        Continuous real-valued variable. Can take any value within given bounds.
    Integer : Vtype
        Discrete integer-valued variable. Takes integer values within bounds.
    Binary : Vtype
        Binary variable. Can only take values 0 or 1.
    Spin : Vtype
        Spin variable. Can only take values -1 or +1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from luna_quantum import Vtype
    >>> Vtype.Real
    Real

    >>> str(Vtype.Binary)
    'Binary'

class Unbounded: ...

class Bounds:
    """
    Represents bounds for a variable (only supported for real and integer variables).

    A `Bounds` object defines the valid interval for a variable. Bounds are inclusive,
    and can be partially specified by providing only a lower or upper limit. If neither
    is specified, the variable is considered unbounded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lower : float, optional
        Lower bound of the variable. Defaults to negative infinity if not specified.
    upper : float, optional
        Upper bound of the variable. Defaults to positive infinity if not specified.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from luna_quantum import Bounds
    >>> Bounds(-1.0, 1.0)
    Bounds { lower: -1, upper: 1 }

    >>> Bounds(lower=0.0)
    Bounds { lower: -1, upper: unlimited }

    >>> Bounds(upper=10.0)
    Bounds { lower: unlimited, upper: 1 }

    Notes
    -----
    - Bounds are only meaningful for variables of type `Vtype.Real` or `Vtype.Integer`.
    - If both bounds are omitted, the variable is unbounded.

class Variable:
    """
    Represents a symbolic variable within an optimization environment.

    A `Variable` is the fundamental building block of algebraic expressions
    used in optimization models. Each variable is tied to an `Environment`
    which scopes its lifecycle and expression context. Variables can be
    typed and optionally bounded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the variable.
    vtype : Vtype, optional
        The variable type (e.g., `Vtype.Real`, `Vtype.Integer`, etc.).
        Defaults to `Vtype.Binary`.
    bounds : Bounds, optional
        Bounds restricting the range of the variable. Only applicable for
        `Real` and `Integer` variables.
    env : Environment, optional
        The environment in which this variable is created. If not provided,
        the current environment from the context manager is used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from luna_quantum import Variable, Environment, Vtype, Bounds
    >>> with Environment():
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     y = Variable("y", vtype=Vtype.Integer, bounds=Bounds(0, 5))
    ...     expr = 2 * x + y - 1

    Arithmetic Overloads
    --------------------
    Variables support standard arithmetic operations:

    - Addition: `x + y`, `x + 2`, `2 + x`
    - Subtraction: `x - y`, `3 - x`
    - Multiplication: `x * y`, `2 * x`, `x * 2`

    All expressions return `Expression` objects and preserve symbolic structure.

    Notes
    -----
    - A `Variable` is bound to a specific `Environment` instance.
    - Variables are immutable; all operations yield new `Expression` objects.
    - Variables carry their environment, but the environment does not own the variable.

class Solution:
    """
    The solution object that is obtained by running an algorihtm.

    The `Solution` class represents a summary of all data obtained from solving a
    model. It contains samples, i.e., assignments of values to each model variable as
    returned by the algorithm, metadata about the solution quality, e.g., the objective
    value, and the runtime of the algorithm.

    A `Solution` can be constructed explicitly using `from_dict` or by obtaining a solution
    from an algorithm or by converting a different solution format with one of the available
    translators. Note that the latter requires the environment the model was created in.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage, assuming that the algorithm already returns a `Solution`:

    >>> from luna_quantum import Model, Solution
    >>> model: Model = ...
    >>> algorithm = ...
    >>> solution: Solution = algorithm.run(model)
    >>> solution.samples
    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]

    When you have a `dimod.Sampleset` as the raw solution format:

    >>> from luna_quantum.translator import BqmTranslator
    >>> from luna_quantum import Model, Solution, DwaveTranslator
    >>> from dimod import SimulatedAnnealingSampler
    >>> model: Model = ...

    >>> solution = DwaveTranslator.from_dimod_sample_set(sampleset)
    >>> solution.samples
    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]

    Serialization:

    >>> blob = solution.encode()
    >>> restored = Solution.decode(blob)

        """
        Build a `Solution` based on the provided input data. The solution is constructed
        based on a column layout of the solution. Let's take the following sample-set with three
        samples as an example:

        [ 0  1  -1  3  2.2  1 ]
        [ 1  0  -1  6  3.8  0 ]
        [ 1  1  +1  2  2.4  0 ]

        Each row encodes a single sample. However, the variable types vary, the first, second, and
        last columns all represent a Binary variable (index 0, 1, 5). The third column represents a
        variable of type Spin (index 2). The fourth column (index 3), a variable of type Integer and
        the fifth column (index 4), a real-valued variable.

        Thus, the `component_types` list is:

        >>> component_types = [Vtype.Binary, Vtype.Binary, Vtype.Spin, Vtype.Integer, Vtype.Real, Vtype.Binary]

        Now we can extract all columns for a binary-valued variable and append them to a new list:

        >>> binary_cols = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]

        where the first element in the list represents the first column, the second element the\
        second column and the third element the fifth column.
        We do the same for the remaining variable types:

        >>> spin_cols = [[-1, -1, +1]]
        >>> int_cols = [[3, 6, 2]]
        >>> real_cols = [[2.2, 3.8, 2.4]]

        If we know the raw energies, we can construct them as well:

        >>> raw_energies = [-200, -100, +300]

        And finally call the `build` function:

        >>> sol = Solution.build(
        ...     component_types,
        ...     binary_cols,
        ...     spin_cols,
        ...     int_cols,
        ...     real_cols,
        ...     raw_energies,
        ...     timing,
        ...     counts=[1, 1, 1]
        ... )
        >>> sol

        In this example, we could also neglect the `counts` as it defaults to `1`
        for all samples if not set:

        >>> sol = Solution.build(
        ...     component_types,
        ...     binary_cols,
        ...     spin_cols,
        ...     int_cols,
        ...     real_cols,
        ...     raw_energies,
        ...     timing
        ... )
        >>> sol


        Parameters

        component_types : list[Vtype]

            column. Required if any element in the `component_types` is `Vtype.Binary`.
        spin_cols : list[list[int]], optional
            The data of all spin-valued columns. Each inner list encodes a single spin-valued

        int_cols : list[list[int]], optional
            The data of all integer-valued columns. Each inner list encodes a single integer valued
            column. Required if any element in the `component_types` is `Vtype.Integer`.

            The data of all real-valued columns. Each inner list encodes a single real-valued
            column. Required if any element in the `component_types` is `Vtype.Real`.

class Model:

    A symbolic optimization model consisting of an objective and constraints.

    The `Model` class represents a structured symbolic optimization problem. It
    combines a scalar objective `Expression`, a collection of `Constraints`, and
    a shared `Environment` that scopes all variables used in the model.

    Models can be constructed explicitly by passing an environment, or implicitly
    by allowing the model to create its own private environment. If constructed
    inside an active `Environment` context (via `with Environment()`), that context
    is used automatically.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : Environment, optional
        The environment in which variables and expressions are created. If not
        provided, the model will either use the current context (if active), or
        create a new private environment.
    name : str, optional
        An optional name assigned to the model.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage:

    >>> from luna_quantum import Model, Variable
    >>> model = Model("MyModel")
    >>> with model.environment:
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     y = Variable("y")
    >>> model.objective = x * y + x
    >>> model.constraints += x >= 0
    >>> model.constraints += y <= 5

    With explicit environment:

    >>> from luna_quantum import Environment
    >>> env = Environment()
    >>> model = Model("ScopedModel", env)
    >>> with env:
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     model.objective = x * x

    Serialization:

    >>> blob = model.encode()
    >>> restored = Model.decode(blob)
    >>> restored.name
    'MyModel'

    Notes
    -----
    - The `Model` class does not solve the optimization problem.
    - Use `.objective`, `.constraints`, and `.environment` to access the symbolic content.
    - Use `encode()` and `decode()` to serialize and recover models.

# _expression.pyi
class Expression:
    """
    Polynomial expression supporting symbolic arithmetic, constraint creation, and encoding.

    An `Expression` represents a real-valued mathematical function composed of variables,
    scalars, and coefficients. Expressions may include constant, linear, quadratic, and
    higher-order terms (cubic and beyond). They are used to build objective functions
    and constraints in symbolic optimization models.

    Expressions support both regular and in-place arithmetic, including addition and
    multiplication with integers, floats, `Variable` instances, and other `Expression`s.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : Environment, optional
        Environment used to scope the expression when explicitly instantiating it.
        Typically, expressions are constructed implicitly via arithmetic on variables.

    Examples
    --------
    Constructing expressions from variables:

    >>> from luna_quantum import Environment, Variable
    >>> with Environment():
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     y = Variable("y")
    ...     expr = 1 + 2 * x + 3 * x * y + x * y * y

    Inspecting terms:

    >>> expr.get_offset()
    1.0
    >>> expr.get_linear(x)
    2.0
    >>> expr.get_quadratic(x, y)
    3.0
    >>> expr.get_higher_order((x, y, y))
    1.0

    In-place arithmetic:

    >>> expr += x
    >>> expr *= 2

    Creating constraints:

    >>> constraint = expr == 10.0
    >>> constraint2 = expr <= 15

    Serialization:

    >>> blob = expr.encode()
    >>> restored = Expression.decode(blob)

    Supported Arithmetic
    --------------------
    The following operations are supported:

    - Addition:
        * `expr + expr` → `Expression`
        * `expr + variable` → `Expression`
        * `expr + int | float` → `Expression`
        * `int | float + expr` → `Expression`

    - In-place addition:
        * `expr += expr`
        * `expr += variable`
        * `expr += int | float`

    - Multiplication:
        * `expr * expr`
        * `expr * variable`
        * `expr * int | float`
        * `int | float * expr`

    - In-place multiplication:
        * `expr *= expr`
        * `expr *= variable`
        * `expr *= int | float`

    - Constraint creation:
        * `expr == constant` → `Constraint`
        * `expr <= constant` → `Constraint`
        * `expr >= constant` → `Constraint`

    Notes
    -----
    - Expressions are mutable: in-place operations (`+=`, `*=`) modify the instance.
    - Expressions are scoped to an environment via the variables they reference.
    - Comparisons like `expr == expr` return `bool`, not constraints.
    - Use `==`, `<=`, `>=` with numeric constants to create constraints.

class Environment:
    """
    Execution context for variable creation and expression scoping.

    An `Environment` provides the symbolic scope in which `Variable` objects are defined.
    It is required for variable construction, and ensures consistency across expressions.
    The environment does **not** store constraints or expressions — it only facilitates
    their creation by acting as a context manager and anchor for `Variable` instances.

    Environments are best used with `with` blocks, but can also be passed manually
    to models or variables.

    Examples
    --------
    Create variables inside an environment:

    >>> from luna_quantum import Environment, Variable
    >>> with Environment() as env:
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     y = Variable("y")

    Serialize the environment state:

    >>> data = env.encode()
    >>> expr = Environment.decode(data)

    Notes
    -----
    - The environment is required to create `Variable` instances.
    - It does **not** own constraints or expressions — they merely reference variables tied to an environment.
    - Environments **cannot be nested**. Only one can be active at a time.
    - Use `encode()` / `decode()` to persist and recover expression trees.

class Constraint:
    """
    A symbolic constraint formed by comparing an expression to a constant.

    A `Constraint` captures a relation of the form:
    `expression comparator constant`, where the comparator is one of:
    `==`, `<=`, or `>=`.

    While constraints are usually created by comparing an `Expression` to a scalar
    (e.g., `expr == 3.0`), they can also be constructed manually using this class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : Expression
        The left-hand side expression.
    rhs : float
        The scalar right-hand side value.
    comparator : Comparator
        The relation between lhs and rhs (e.g., `Comparator.Eq`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from luna_quantum import Environment, Variable, Constraint, Comparator
    >>> with Environment():
    ...     x = Variable("x")
    ...     c = Constraint(x + 2, 5.0, Comparator.Eq)

    Or create via comparison:

    >>> expr = 2 * x + 1
    >>> c2 = expr <= 10.0

    A collection of symbolic constraints used to define a model.

    Constraints are typically added using `add_constraint()` or the `+=` operator.
