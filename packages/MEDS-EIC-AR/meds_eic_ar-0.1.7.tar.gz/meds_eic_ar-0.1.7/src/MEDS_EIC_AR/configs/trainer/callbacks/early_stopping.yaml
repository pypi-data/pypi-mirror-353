  patience: 3 # number of checks with no improvement after which training will be stopped

  verbose: False # verbosity mode

  mode: "min" # "max" means higher metric value is better, can be also "min"

  strict: True # whether to crash the training if monitor is not found in the validation metrics
  check_finite: True # when set True, stops training when the monitor becomes NaN or infinite

  stopping_threshold: null # stop training immediately once the monitored quantity reaches this
  divergence_threshold: null # stop training as soon as the monitored quantity becomes worse than this
  check_on_train_epoch_end: null # whether to run early stopping at the end of the training epoch
