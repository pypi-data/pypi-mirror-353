# tox.ini exists because pyproject.toml is not supported by pycodestyle,
# and because setup.cfg would be rewritten by 'python -m build'.

# pycodestyle does not support toml in the sense that a [tool.pycodestyle]
# section in a pyproject.toml file is ignored.
# However 'python -m build ...' an sdist writes a setup.cfg file, or if one
# already exists rewrites it ignoring comments and appends some stuff.
# Hence the non-comment content of this setup.cfg survives to provide the
# [pycodestyle] section.

# E203 to fit black formatting and pylint.
# W503 is only default ignore which occurs at 2022-09-02, and style is what
# black formatting does if needed.  My preference is break after operator
# but easier to let black do what it wants.
