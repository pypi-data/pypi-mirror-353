"""Provide classes which define binding and traversal methods for text.

The methods are shared by classes in cqldisplay and querydisplay modules
which display plain text.

The cqldisplay module has two sets of classes: based on the _CQLDisplay and
CQLDialogue classes.

The querydisplay module has an identical structure where the _CQLDisplay
and _QueryDisplay classes have many methods in common.

All methods in the classes in this module existed as multiple copies in various
classes in the cqldisplay and querydisplay modules.  They are now deleted
from those modules.

The classes in this module represent the different sets of classes with methods
in common.  Two classes could reasonably be called DisplayText: the choice is
consistent with the naming of InsertText and EditText.  ShowText was chosen for
the other class.

The ShowText class is populated with the methods identical in _CQLDisplay
and _QueryDisplay, which were then removed from those two classes.

The DisplayText class is populated with the methods identical in CQLDisplay
and QueryDisplay, which were then removed from those two classes.

The InsertText class is populated with the methods identical in
CQLDisplayInsert and QueryDisplayInsert, which were then removed from those
two classes.

The EditText class is populated with the methods identical in
CQLDisplayEdit and QueryDisplayEdit, which were then removed from those two
classes.  It probably should be a subclass of InsertText, but this depends on
successful choice of method resolution order in the classes in cqldisplay and
querydisplay modules.
