"""Provide Chess Query Language (ChessQL) editor in Toplevel widgets.

ChessQL statements obey the syntax published for CQL version 6.0.1 (by Gady
Costeff).

These two classes display ChessQL statements in their own Toplevel widget:
they are used in the cqldbdelete, cqldbedit, and cqldbshow, modules.
