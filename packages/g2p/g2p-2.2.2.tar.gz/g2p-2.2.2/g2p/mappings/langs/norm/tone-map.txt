Notes on tone bars by Eric Joanis, reflecting research done with Pat Littell.

The following is a list of all the tone accents and their equivalent tone bars.

Note: this mapping might not be a good idea for our panphon proprocessor, because the
correct placement of the tone bars is not always right after the vowel that had the tone
accent, and panphon does not like the result of applying the panphon processor that simply
applies to mapping without reordering taking into account the rest of the syllable.

The mapping is partially based based on the IPA picker: https://r12a.github.io/pickers/ipa/
but that site is missing \u1dc6 and \u1dc7. I have mapped them by parallel with the other
similar accents.

Tone accents shown by themselves, usually easy to see, but not always rendered correctly:

\u0300 =  ̀ -> ˨
\u0301 =  ́ -> ˦
\u0302 =  ̂ -> ˥˩
\u0304 =  ̄ -> ˧
\u030b =  ̋ -> ˥
\u030c =  ̌ -> ˩˥
\u030f =  ̏ -> ˩
\u1dc4 =  ᷄ -> ˦˥
\u1dc5 =  ᷅ -> ˩˨
\u1dc6 =  ᷆ -> ˨˩
\u1dc7 =  ᷇ -> ˥˦
\u1dc8 =  ᷈ -> ˧˦˧

Tone accents shown on a letter to make them render correctly:

\u0300 = à -> ˨
\u0301 = á -> ˦
\u0302 = â -> ˥˩
\u0304 = ā -> ˧
\u030b = a̋ -> ˥
\u030c = ǎ -> ˩˥
\u030f = ȁ -> ˩
\u1dc4 = a᷄ -> ˦˥
\u1dc5 = a᷅ -> ˩˨
\u1dc6 = a᷆ -> ˨˩
\u1dc7 = a᷇ -> ˥˦
\u1dc8 = a᷈ -> ˧˦˧

Question: Chris Cox suggests that \u1dc4 to \u1dc5 could use, e.g., mid-to-veryhigh, instead
of high-to-veryhigh, interpreting the accent shape more strictly. However, the IPA picker
uses high-to-veryhigh.

IPA picker option:
\u1dc4 =  ᷄ -> ˦˥
\u1dc5 =  ᷅ -> ˩˨
\u1dc6 =  ᷆ -> ˨˩
\u1dc7 =  ᷇ -> ˥˦

Alternative option with stricter correspondance to tone accents:
\u1dc4 =  ᷄ -> ˧˥
\u1dc5 =  ᷅ -> ˩˧
\u1dc6 =  ᷆ -> ˧˩
\u1dc7 =  ᷇ -> ˥˧

Is there an official standard to these?

If we want to activate replacing by tone accents by tone bars, right after the character
where the accent was, we can use this set of rules in panphon_preprocessor.csv:
\u0300,˨
\u0301,˦
\u0302,˥˩
\u0304,˧
\u030b,˥
\u030c,˩˥
\u030f,˩
\u1dc4,˦˥
\u1dc5,˩˨
\u1dc6,˨˩
\u1dc7,˥˦
\u1dc8,˧˦˧
but I'm not activating this yet, since it doesn't place the tone bars where Panphon 0.19
likes them.
