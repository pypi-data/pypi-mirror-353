## Features

- Auto-refreshing credentials for long-lived `boto3` sessions
- Drop-in replacement for `boto3.session.Session`
- Supports `assume_role` configuration, custom STS clients, and profile / region configuration, as well as all other parameters supported by `boto3.session.Session`
- Tested, documented, and published to PyPI
- Used in production at major tech companies

## Adoption and Recognition

[Mentioned in TL;DR Sec](https://tldrsec.com/p/tldr-sec-282).

Received honorable mention during AWS Community Day Midwest on June 5th, 2025.

Used by multiple teams and large companies including FAANG.

The following line plot illustrates the adoption of BRS from the last three months in terms of average daily downloads over a rolling seven day window.

## Testimonials

From a Cyber Security Engineer at a FAANG company:

> _Most of my work is on tooling related to AWS security, so I'm pretty choosy about boto3 credentials-adjacent code. I often opt to just write this sort of thing myself so I at least know that I can reason about it. But I found boto3-refresh-session to be very clean and intuitive [...] We're using the RefreshableSession class as part of a client cache construct [...] We're using AWS Lambda to perform lots of operations across several regions in hundreds of accounts, over and over again, all day every day. And it turns out that there's a surprising amount of overhead to creating boto3 clients (mostly deserializing service definition json), so we can run MUCH more efficiently if we keep a cache of clients, all equipped with automatically refreshing sessions._

## Installation

```bash
pip install boto3-refresh-session
```

## Usage

```python
import boto3_refresh_session as brs

# you can pass all of the params associated with boto3.session.Session
profile_name = '<your-profile-name>'
region_name = 'us-east-1'
...

# as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client.assume_role
assume_role_kwargs = {
  'RoleArn': '<your-role-arn>',
  'RoleSessionName': '<your-role-session-name>',
  'DurationSeconds': '<your-selection>',
  ...
}

# as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client, except for 'service_name'
sts_client_kwargs = {
  'region_name': region_name,
  ...
}

# basic initialization of boto3.session.Session
session = brs.RefreshableSession(
  assume_role_kwargs=assume_role_kwargs, # required
  sts_client_kwargs=sts_client_kwargs,
  region_name=region_name,
  profile_name=profile_name,
  ...
)

# now you can create clients, resources, etc. without worrying about expired temporary 
# security credentials
s3 = session.client(service_name='s3')
buckets = s3.list_buckets()
```

## Raison d'être

It is common for data pipelines and workflows that interact with the AWS API via 
`boto3` to run for a long time and, accordingly, for temporary credentials to 
expire. 

Usually, engineers deal with that problem one of two ways: 

- `try except` blocks that catch `ClientError` exceptions
- A similar approach as that used in this project -- that is, using methods available 
  within `botocore` for refreshing temporary credentials automatically. 
  
Speaking personally, variations of the code found herein exists in code bases at 
nearly every company where I have worked. Sometimes, I turned that code into a module; 
other times, I wrote it from scratch. Clearly, that is inefficient.

I decided to finally turn that code into a proper Python package with unit testing, 
automatic documentation, and quality checks; the idea being that, henceforth, depending 
on my employer's open source policy, I may simply import this package instead of 
reproducing the code herein for the Nth time.

If any of that sounds relatable, then `boto3-refresh-session` should help you.
