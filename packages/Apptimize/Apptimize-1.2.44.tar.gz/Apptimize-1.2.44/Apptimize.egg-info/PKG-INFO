        ===========
        
        The Apptimize Python Server SDK allows application developers to run A/B tests and manage feature flags across Python server instances. The SDK is used by Apptimize Cross-Platform customers in conjunction with the Apptimize Dashboard, which provides a web-based interface for managing experiments and feature flags.
        
        In addition, the Apptimize Python Server SDK can be used with client-side SDKs from Apptimize for iOS, Android, tvOS, Android TV, and JavaScript in order to manage the entire end-user digital experience and understand how users interact across different channels.
