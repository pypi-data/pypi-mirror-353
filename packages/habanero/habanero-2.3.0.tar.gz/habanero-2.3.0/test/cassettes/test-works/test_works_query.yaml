      is perhaps the most important, but least formally discussed, aspect of current
      ecological research and teaching. The last twenty years has demonstrated that
      this is no longer a viable approach and the rise of climate change research,
      and its concomitant denial, has brought disagreement and outright refusal to
      accept facts to the research community and the wider world. This has, in turn,
      produced a vigorous research community aimed specifically at challenging false
      ideas and getting accurate science fully embedded into the public sphere. What
      is less common is an exploration of the parameters surrounding communication
      and the outputs of discourse. Ecology suffers from exactly the same problems
      as climate science but without the mass of research exploring the issues and
      potential solutions. The aim of this article is to propose a model of communication
      and outline the key factors involved as well as point toward some solutions.
      As far as can be ascertained, there is no model of ecological communication
      extant. Some research has put forward some elements but it is far from comprehensive.
      It became obvious that using a systems model would provide the base needed.
      Research starts with gathering data (input), working on that data (processing),
      and producing an end product that people can see\/use (output). At this stage,
      the model can be left as it is because it follows the usual route of current
      research (as exemplified by academia, for example). However, it was proposed,
      early on, to broaden this remit. The original goal was to explore how information
      can be distorted between production and (often multiple chains of) users and
      how such distortion might be ameliorated. This started in climate science but
      has recently moved to ecology. Thus, the final iteration of the proposed model
      consists of four parts. The first is the creation of a product\u2014usually
      research project and associated data. This aspect is subject to a range of political
      and logistical biases thus ensuring that the aim of studying all aspects of
      ecology is unlikely to be achieved. From here, data go into the process of being
      prepared for publication. Again, a series of forces control and constrain what
      is able to be later communicated. This ranges from philosophical and ideological
      limitations through to political and sociological filters. Cognition plays a
      key part not only in interpreting data but also introducing bias (deliberate
      or otherwise) into the results. From there, the move is to publish. Consumers
      take material from a range of media who may, or may not, have allowed publication.
      It is also the place where research output gets a wider airing and where further
      misinterpretation can be found. Normally, this would feed back into initial
      product stage but here the aim is to create a fourth division, a precursor,
      that argues that by studying issues in ecological communication, adaptations
      can be made to make it more effective and less prone to mis\/disinformation.
      The aim here is to provide a practical element to assist improvement of ecological
      communication.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0238","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,25]],"date-time":"2022-07-25T14:38:07Z","timestamp":1658759887000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Communicating

      is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally
      to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings
      are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their respective
      ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. The result is a vast communicative
      interplay, fundamental to the fabric of life\u201d (Eisner and Meinwald 1995,
      p. v), cited under General Overviews). Chemical ecology is the study of ecological
      interactions between organisms mediated by chemicals produced by those organisms.
      Chemical interactions between organisms can be analyzed across all organizational
      levels, reaching from cell-cell interaction and intraspecific and multitrophic-level
      interactions to whole community interactions and environmental ecological processes.
      Because of their ubiquity, chemical signals that carry information (semiochemicals)
      can be categorized by the types of ecological interactions they mediate, such
      as intraspecific social communication, antagonistic interactions, and mutualism.
      Accordingly, this article is organized into three core areas, one formed by
      the chemicals mediating interactions between members of the same species (pheromones),
      and the others by interspecific interactions involving allomones (where the
      sender benefits), and synomones (where both sender and receivers benefit). A
      fourth group of signals, kairomones (where the receiver benefits), can comprise
      all other signal categories when they are perceived and utilized by a third
      organism that itself gains a benefit from eavesdropping on communication between
      others. While primary studies in chemical ecology focused on the identification
      of compounds mediating interactions between organisms, today\u2019s debates
      are dominated by micro- and macroevolutionary aspects of chemical interactions.
      The very rapid growth of the chemical ecology literature over recent decades
      has been, in part, driven by the growing appreciation of the high economic value
      of understanding chemical communication, reaching from applications in pest
      management over the control of disease vectors in agriculture to the use of
      chemical signals in medicine. Moreover, the field has dramatically profited
      from innovations in analytical chemistry, making the separation of complex compound
      mixtures as well as the identification of compound structures efficient and
      accessible to a broader community of researchers. Recent advances in molecular
      ecology have aided an even more rapid mechanistic and functional analysis of
      semiochemicals, leading to a modern consolidation of different research fields.
      This collection of significant publications focuses on the functional and evolutionary
      analysis of chemical signals important in mediating ecological interactions.
      Moreover, attention has been given to publications that provide conceptual frameworks
      and are among the most highly cited in the respective subdisciplines. They can
      thus provide a good introduction for the interested reader and allow efficient
      forward and backward searching for more detailed information.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0023","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Chemical
